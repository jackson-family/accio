Today, Emily started preschool! She will go to preschool twice a week from 9:30
to 1:30. Emily&#x02bc;s teacher is Miss Rachel, and there are eight kids in her
class. The first thing that she told me when I picked her up is that they played
outside on the playground. Important things! Emily also announced that Cassy is
her friend. There was some talk about a boy named Gabriel, pronounced like
&ldquo;Gay. *pause* Breel.&rdquo; I tried to ask about other things, and all I
could get out of her was that she had a small snack of goldfish and sang
&ldquo;Three Little Monkeys Swinging in the Tree.&rdquo; (The snack must have
been not so small because the remnants of Emily&#x02bc;s lunch box would suggest
that she ate four chips, two baby carrots, maybe four blueberries, and a cheese
stick for lunch. Awesome.)

So, today went OK. I didn&#x02bc;t have any trouble dropping Emily off, though I
did get a little lump in my throat leaving her there to play with Mega Blocks by
herself and hoping hoping hoping that she would find another friend to play with
soon. She looked so small and so grown up at the same time. When I picked her
up, she smiled and came to me, but it was all very dignified. No running down
the hall or clinging.

And what did I do? It was pretty exciting. I put away a ton of laundry, made
cornbread and banana bread, played with Molly, and ate lunch by myself. I could
get used to this.
