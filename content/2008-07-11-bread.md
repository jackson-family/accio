Lately, we&#x02bc;ve both had baking bread on the brain, so I suggested that our
date night be a night of baking bread. And William simply said, &ldquo;I want to
make bread.&rdquo; And so we checked in my trusty, never-fail _Ultimate Southern
Living Cookbook_ to find something suitable for our date night on Thursday. The
recipe we settled upon without any argument (amazingly enough, because there are
many delicious-looking breads in that cookbook) was Honey-Oat Bread, a recipe
that had flour, oats, honey, and milk, and a smattering of other ingredients
that magically turn into bread.

(Note: to those of you who are food blog addicts, this description of our
collective efforts will seem horribly undescriptive. Just go to the pictures of
the bread &hellip;) The bread-making process is simple enough but so much more
pleasant with a helper. William got the yeast ready, while I combined the wet
ingredients. William stirred the dough while I added flour. I kneaded, somewhat
nervously because kneading is not an intuitive process for me, while William
doled out more flour as needed. William washed the bowl for the bread to rise
in. After the bread had doubled in size, William rolled it out and put it into
the loaf pans. And then we had to wait for it to rise some more before finally
popping it into the oven. It had to bake for 45 minutes, and we could smell the
bread after 20. Mmm!

And here is what we ended up with.

So, it looked pretty good. You may ask how it tasted. We ate it for breakfast
this morning, and I ate one slice untoasted and one slice toasted. I&#x02bc;m
not that big of a toast fan to begin with, but this bread was actually better
toasted than plain. Amazing!

I think we can call this one a success. Any suggestions for the next kind of
yeast bread that we should try?
