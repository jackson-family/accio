Last night was our first night at the house. It&#x02bc;s about time! We have
owned the house for almost a month now, and we hadn&#x02bc;t spent the night in
it until last night. We are patient people.

Greg Harward, a neighbor and member of our ward, told us that our neighborhood
has a &ldquo;rabbit problem&rdquo;. I wasn&#x02bc;t sure what to make of that
until Rebecca and I looked out the window and saw a rabbit in our yard! We think
it might be eating things out of our garden. Strangely, it didn&#x02bc;t touch
the peppers. Clearly it was not a true Texan rabbit if it could not handle the
heat.

Our house is so much more comfortable now that we have places to sit. Rebecca
did an excellent job matching the paint color to our furniture. I would have
been sad if it didn&#x02bc;t match, because it took a lot of work to paint.

When we eat dinner now, we don&#x02bc;t have to look out the window and see
someone else&#x02bc;s patio. We can look at our own! Also, there are no banging
or crying noises coming from upstairs and no smelly cigarette smoke outside our
front door.

We always get the best parking spot.

Our new home makes me happy, and I know Rebecca is happy here, too. We had a
good night&#x02bc;s sleep and no trouble with the shower or anything else this
morning, and we got to church earlier than we have all year. We love our house
and our neighborhood, and we look forward to many happy years here.
