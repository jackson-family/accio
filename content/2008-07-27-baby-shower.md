Last weekend, I volunteered to do the food for my visiting teacher&#x02bc;s baby
shower. I figured that would be much safer than doing the games, which are
usually completely ridiculous at baby showers. (I&#x02bc;ve never understood why
a bride- or mother-to-be would willingly subject herself to public humiliation
from her friends, just to get a few presents! Not worth it!)  But I knew this
shower was coming, so I had time to plan out a decent menu and figure out how to
prep the food so that I wouldn&#x02bc;t be up to 3 a.m. the day before baking.

Here&#x02bc;s what we decided to make:

*   crepes with chocolate mousse, powdered sugar, Nutella, caramel, and
    strawberries
*   [quiche Lorraine][a] (but I made my own crusts &mdash; Mmm!)
*   [chicken salad][b] croissant sandwiches
*   lemon almond bread
*   mixed fruit
*   Brie cheese baked with a nutty sweet sauce on top, with sourdough bread
*   chocolate cake
*   lemonade

So, I didn&#x02bc;t actually make *all* of that. Katie, the woman who hosted the
shower at her house, made the crepes ahead of time, another sister in our ward
made this amazing chocolate cake that was decorated all cute, and my visiting
teaching companion bought the lemonade.

But then I made everything else. On Thursday night I made the quiche crust, and
William cooked the bacon. And he went to the grocery store with me during all of
those trips for the lemon and the cream cheese that I forgot. And then on Friday
night before, I baked the lemon bread, assembled the quiche and baked that, and
then made the chicken salad. Saturday morning, I assembled the sandwiches,
sliced up the baguettes, and made the topping for the cheese. Given that we made
food for 20 in my little apartment kitchen, everything went surprisingly well,
and I even got a good night&#x02bc;s sleep Friday night.

Here&#x02bc;s a picture of the food after we got it all set out!

And the shower was fun. Lots of sisters from our ward came, and Katie did a
great job with the games and keeping everything moving at a good pace. And I had
a blast making all of that food. So much fun!
