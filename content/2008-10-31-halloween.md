This is not a &ldquo;Look how cute my kid&#x02bc;s costume is at the Ward Trunk
or Treat&rdquo; post. No kids, so no cute costumes. Maybe someday &hellip;
You&#x02bc;ll have to settle for a scary picture of me. I&#x02bc;m not a big
Halloween person. I was the Bride of Frankenstein in the fifth grade, but I
think that was my Halloween high point (and what a high point it was. Maybe
that&#x02bc;s why I haven&#x02bc;t tried an awesome costume since.) But I can
respect the day all the same.

So, this year, I wore black to work, with my awesome red lipstick and daring
black eyeliner. William wore an orange (albeit burnt orange with a longhorn)
tie. And we had a sort of Halloween-y dinner with friends: [mummy dogs][a],
cobweb fries (really waffle fries), salad, [Magic in the Middle cookies][b], and
[pumpkin seeds][c]. (By the way, those Magic in the Middle cookies are really
something amazing.) I even went out and bought four bags of candy, but no kids
came by. So, now we&#x02bc;re kind of in the same situation as many of you: too
much candy in the house, and not enough people to eat it. Happy Halloween!
