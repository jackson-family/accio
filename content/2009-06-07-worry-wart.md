Tuesday night, I witnessed something that most of you have experienced. We came
home from work, and William changed into a suit and headed back to the church
for a meeting.  It was a meeting with the Elder&#x02bc;s Quorum presidency and
the home teaching district leaders, I assume, to discuss the (astonishing?
deplorable? William didn&#x02bc;t specify.) home teaching efforts for May.
He&#x02bc;s had one of these meetings before, so before he left, he said,
&ldquo;The last meeting was about an hour long, so I should be home no later
than 8:30.&rdquo;

Fine by me. I settled in for an evening of puttering around the house and
started making dinner so that it would be ready by 8:30.

William is good about calling when he&#x02bc;s on his way home from somewhere,
so I started listening for my phone to ring around 8:00. I was getting pretty
hungry, too, but I didn&#x02bc;t want to start eating dinner if William were on
his way home. At 8:15, I put my phone in my pocket to make sure that I
didn&#x02bc;t miss the call and started munching on some of those ridiculously
tasty watermelon candies that my sister brings me from the BYU Bookstore because
I can&#x02bc;t find them here. At 8:30, I pulled my phone out to make sure that
I hadn&#x02bc;t somehow missed a call. And then I started to worry. Five minutes
of little worries (I hope he&#x02bc;s OK. Should I call?) and still no phone
call.

Then the elaborate scenarios started coming. Here&#x02bc;s a taste.

1. His meeting ran late. (But no way. What church meeting runs late? He *said*
   8:30!)
2. They&#x02bc;re having car trouble and are stranded by the interstate
   somewhere. (But he would&#x02bc;ve called, right? I could&#x02bc;ve gone to
   pick them up, easy.)
3. They&#x02bc;ve been in a car accident and are on their way to the hospital.
   (Hmm, I can&#x02bc;t really find anything flawed with that one because
   it&#x02bc;s hard to call when you&#x02bc;re in the back of an ambulance
   strapped to a gurney.)
4. The church is in a not so nice part of town, so an armed gang entered the
   church and they are all being held hostage until someone can meet their
   demands. (OK, do these robbers think that Mormons actually have money to pay
   a ransom? Uh oh!)
5. William is dead (inexplicably, but remember, this is my brain telling the
   story here), and I&#x02bc;m going to have to raise my child alone. (Likely.
   Otherwise, he would&#x02bc;ve called by now! And then I started thinking
   about the first 10 minutes of the new _Star Trek_ movie. Sigh.)

And so my thoughts continued in a similar vein until 8:50 when I thought,
&ldquo;Meeting be *darned*. I&#x02bc;m checking on him,&rdquo; and sent him a
text message. My phone rang just a few minutes later, and William said,
&ldquo;My meeting ran late, and then my ride had to stick around for a few
minutes to discuss private elder&#x02bc;s quorum business. I&#x02bc;m on my way
home now.&rdquo; *Whew.* &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; 20 minutes later, he showed
up, nary a scratch, bandage, or gunshot wound in sight. All was well.

Why am I such a worry wart?
