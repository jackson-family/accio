Emily has been laughing for some time now. Her biggest laughs usually come in
the morning when I&#x02bc;m dressing her and have no way of getting to the
camera in time. But we finally got a good video of her. I&#x02bc;ve watched it
at least a dozen times, and it still makes me smile. As my grandmother says, it
seems that we have a very jolly baby!
