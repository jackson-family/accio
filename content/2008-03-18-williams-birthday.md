William turned 26 on March 17. It was a happy day. We went to the grocery store,
took a run around the neighborhood, ate corndogs for dinner, and opened
presents. William was really, really happy.

I gave him the complete *Chronicles of Narnia* (and finally used our Deseret
Book gift card from the wedding.)

Here are some of the cards that he got from friends and family. Happy Birthday,
indeed!
