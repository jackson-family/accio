Our house came with a beautifully maintained garden box, and I tried in vain,
midst record-breaking heat, a multi-year drought, and late pregnancy girth, to
keep it going last summer. The only things that grew without much intervention
from me were basil and Anaheim peppers. Everything else pretty much put up the
feeblest of efforts to stay alive and in the shade of the basil plant. However,
this spring, much to our surprise, a giant dill plant emerged, along with an
asparagus that must have been hiding underground all last year. Too bad
I&#x02bc;m not a fan of asparagus.

I&#x02bc;ve spent a lot of time reading books and websites (thank you, Texas
A&amp;M!) about gardening and how we could proceed. It really seemed
overwhelming because there were a lot of weeds and grass growing in the garden.
My mom helpfully pointed out that the soil was probably still very rich and that
I didn&#x02bc;t need to worry too much about trying to get new dirt or special
fertilizers. With that encouragement, I decided that I just needed to clear out
the stuff that wasn&#x02bc;t supposed to be there and get something into the
ground before it was too late and then I could supplement with other plants as
needed.

It&#x02bc;s a good thing that Emily takes such a good morning nap every day
because it&#x02bc;s given me time to work outside before it gets too hot.
(Honestly, you didn&#x02bc;t think I could write a blog without mentioning Emily
somehow, did you?)

It&#x02bc;s not in perfect condition yet &mdash; I still have a lot of grass to
clear out and probably could tidy up the rocks in the middle. But it&#x02bc;s a
start. Here are a few pictures of what we&#x02bc;ve got so far. I&#x02bc;m still
hopeful that I can get a few more plants in this week, like sweet peppers and
maybe some onions. Wish me luck.
