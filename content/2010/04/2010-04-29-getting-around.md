I realize that I&#x02bc;ve slightly neglected this blog and haven&#x02bc;t
really documented Emily&#x02bc;s latest achievements. But you should know that
she now has two sharp bottom teeth and can crawl across the room. I don&#x02bc;t
have any good pictures of the sharp teeth. It&#x02bc;s a dangerous business,
taking pictures of teeth in a baby who has recently learned what teeth are good
for (biting). Just trust me when I say that they are there in fine form.

What I do have plenty of pictures (and a video!) of is Emily&#x02bc;s transition
to crawling. Just a few weeks ago, we saw her doing this:

<video controls preload="metadata"><source src="{static}/images/2010-04-14-roll.mp4"></video>

Roll, clap 3 times, and repeat across the room to her desired destination. It
seemed to be working quite well and her aim was accurate enough. Life was good.

And then one day, she started crawling without any warning or explanation. And
she has decided that she likes crawling even better than rolling! To me, she
looks kind of like a crocodile sneaking up for a good bite (remember the sharp
teeth?) but it&#x02bc;s still very cute. See for yourself.

(Also, she should get bonus points for having such excellent taste in
literature, no?)
