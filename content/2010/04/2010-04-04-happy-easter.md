Happy Easter to all! We&#x02bc;re having a good Easter so far, with hot cross
buns for breakfast and a little Easter egg hunt around our house. Emily&#x02bc;s
getting into the spirit of the day, too.

If you&#x02bc;re worried about her eating too many Easter treats, her egg was
actually filled with sweet potato puffs, just a little better than a
Reese&#x02bc;s peanut butter egg, right?

And here she is in her cute Easter dress that Mom bought for her.

Most important, [this video][e] reminds me of the importance of Easter. Enjoy!
