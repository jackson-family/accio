So, I mentioned in my last post that Emily has started crawling, and now she can
get to almost any place that she wants to be. She&#x02bc;s surprisingly fast,
and just today, I found myself trying to block her from getting into a pantry or
the refrigerator while I was making dinner.

Her favorite place to explore is our food pantry where she can get into the
plastic containers and the extra bottles of formula. (That&#x02bc;s the face she
makes when she sees the camera. Is she a ham or what?)

She also likes to bang on the vent beneath the air conditioner. And her new
favorite &ldquo;Push Mom&#x02bc;s Buttons&rdquo; trick is to pull the kitchen
towel off of the towel rack immediately after I&#x02bc;ve put it back up nicely.
It seems to be her personal mission to keep that towel rack from a life of
suspended misery when it could be comfortably wadded up on the floor.

Yes, being able to move around from Point A to Point B is making Emily one happy
little lady.

Bonus feature 1: she loves *loves* William&#x02bc;s guitar. Like she makes excited
little grunting noises as she crawls towards it, filled with the anticipation of
giving it a good plucking.

Bonus feature 2: Emily figured how to do this today. *Whaaat?*
