We got our last box of vegetables from our CSA two weeks ago and have decided
not to continue. As much as I love the idea of getting fresh-from-the-farm
vegetables, I just couldn&#x02bc;t handle how adventurous I had to be when using
them. For instance, last summer, for at least eight weeks in a row, we were
inundated with eggplants and peppers. And now I completely hate eggplant because
I&#x02bc;m still sick of them. So, I&#x02bc;ll just be picking out the veggies
that I want when I want them and in a suitable quantity for two adults and an
infant.

That said, our last box came with these.

And the box before that came with a similar sized bunch, only the carrots were
shorter. And the box before *that* came with a bunch of teeny carrots. And of
course, my limited imagination doesn&#x02bc;t allow me to get very far past
&ldquo;carrot cake&rdquo; when I wonder what to do with our carrot stockpile.

Emily to the rescue! I decided that she needed to learn to love carrots, which
is something that I never did, though probably not for lack of effort on my
parents&#x02bc; parts. Anyway. I chopped, steamed, and pureed one pound of
organic, farm-fresh carrots, and divided that up into an ice cube tray. Now
whenever I need food for Emily, I take out one of the carrot cubes, thaw it in
the refrigerator, and feed it to her over the next two or three days.

You can see for yourself how well it&#x02bc;s going.
