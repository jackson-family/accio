I&#x02bc;m not one that feels the need to talk about the weather, since
it&#x02bc;s usually pretty boring, especially here in Texas. However, this week
we had weather that definitely wasn&#x02bc;t boring, so I feel like I can share
this.

On Monday, it came to my attention that snow was forecasted for Tuesday. This
isn&#x02bc;t terribly unusual, but the forecast usually never pans out. So,
imagine my surprise on Tuesday morning when I opened my curtains to this.

It snowed! Like honest to goodness big fat fluffy flakes fell from the sky
almost all day long. These pictures show the progress throughout the day. (Note
to those of you on the East Coast: sorry this doesn&#x02bc;t compare to your
blizzard, but still, you have to admit that *any* snow in Austin is pretty
amazing.)

And Emily took it quite well. I didn&#x02bc;t take her out in it because it was
too cold, but she watched it from the back window and seemed pretty interested
in it.
