I have a few friends with awesome digital SLR cameras, and their blogs have
really cute artsy pictures of their kids. I&#x02bc;m totally jealous of them,
and I often wish I had a big fancy camera complete with a thick strap to wear it
around my neck. Something about that neckstrap just means Business. Anyway.

Nonetheless, we do pretty well with our little point-and-shoot that we&#x02bc;ve
had since William won it at his work&#x02bc;s Christmas party. And I
don&#x02bc;t really *need* an SLR since our camera still takes cute pictures
like this one.
