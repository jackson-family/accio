The problem with going up the stairs is that, inevitably, one must come down
again. Until last week, Emily could go up the stairs but not really get down
gracefully. We practiced going down stairs by sitting and bum-bumping down. You
know, as opposed to falling headfirst and dissolving into a puddle of tears. But
I would always hold her hand and bump alongside her.

This week, Emily finally figured out how to go down the stairs without any adult
assistance. She surprised us by climbing to the top and then turned around and
bum-bumped all the way down hands-free, beaming the whole way. And now her life
is pretty much complete because she can sneak anywhere in the house without us
knowing about it. It&#x02bc;s positively thrilling.
