Emily turned 1 on Tuesday. Instead of writing a tear-jerker post about how time
flies, or how my baby went from [this ball of fluff][a] to [this cheeseball][b],
I&#x02bc;m just going to post pictures from her two birthday parties.

## The Waco Party

Apparently we didn&#x02bc;t do a good job of explaining the function of birthday
candles.

Yay for cake! (Do you like how careful she&#x02bc;s being with it?)

I&#x02bc;m sad that this picture is blurry because look how excited she is to
get a present!

A picture book with nothing but kittens. Best birthday present ever!

## The Austin Party

We played Jenga

And ate gobs of guacamole.

We opened presents.

We tried on a new bib. (Thanks, Janelle!)

![Emily with her feather boa][l]

[l]: {static}/images/2010-08-14-emily-birthday-05.jpg

We luxuriated in our new feather boa. (In restrospect, this may not have been
the best move on my part because now my house is littered with tiny little
feathers, almost as if a pillow exploded in my living room.)

![Emily with a birthday card and a dollar bill][m]

[m]: {static}/images/2010-08-14-emily-birthday-06.jpg

We earned a dollar. (Thanks, Great-Grandma Jackson!)

![Emily eating chocolate cake][n]

[n]: {static}/images/2010-08-14-emily-birthday-07.jpg

We ate more cake. (Again, see how careful she is?)

Happy Birthday, Emily!
