Last week, Emily and I joined our friends Tiffany and Cassandra and their baby
girls for a mom-venture at the sprinkler park. (Tiffany&#x02bc;s term, not to be
confused with a &ldquo;dad-venture&rdquo; where a child does something fun with
Dad.) All three babies were born within three months of each other, so we all
compare notes on the ups and downs of keeping a baby alive and happy. And I
loved seeing two of my favorite people from my single days. (Tiffany gets a
shoutout for bringing me and William together, but that&#x02bc;s a story for
another day.)

The sprinkler park is pretty much the best place ever to turn an almost-walker
loose for a bit. We&#x02bc;ve been twice now, and Emily comes home exhausted
because she plays so hard. She crawls and splashes and plugs up the jets and
gets squirted in the face and <strike>steals toys from</strike> shares toys with
the other kids. It&#x02bc;s a great time.

Tiffany was nice enough to take these cute pictures for us.

I put this picture on here to show that I&#x02bc;m one of those moms
that&#x02bc;s not afraid to get her hair wet. (We were there with a rich moms
playgroup, and they all had perfect hair and makeup and ate Rice Krispy treats
while their kids played. What fun is that??) Please excuse my cheesy grin.

Emily and Jillian. Emily is kind of taken with Jillian because Jillian is an
amazing walker and has the same color hair as Emily. They kind of look like
twins to me.

These pictures crack me up because it&#x02bc;s pretty much how the entire
morning went. Emily had her tasty snacks and was enjoying them just fine, thank
you. And then Jillian got interested. Aly was just trying to keep up with the
two big girls.

Here Jillian has taken Emily&#x02bc;s snacks by some kind of force but is also
interested in whatever Aly&#x02bc;s eating. And Emily is cool with it all.
Probably because by this point, she&#x02bc;d already eaten half of
Jillian&#x02bc;s banana.

Emily is still cool. Jillian and Aly have their own little thing going on. 
illian is hogging all of the snacks and not sharing with *anyone*.

Thanks to all the girls for a fun morning!
