I wish I could take credit as the gardener of these vegetables, but alas, they
are from the grocery store. (However, if you need grape tomatoes or basil,
I&#x02bc;m your gal!) Anyway, Emily was rightly fascinated with these
vegetables, and you probably would be too if they were nearly your size.

Here we are with the largest cucumber I&#x02bc;ve ever seen. Good thing we have
a lot of Greek food planned over the next few days!
