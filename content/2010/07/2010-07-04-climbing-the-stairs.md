Over the last few weeks, it&#x02bc;s like Emily has just exploded with new
talents. She learned to army crawl, sit up, and pull herself up in a matter of
days. Lately, her favorite thing is to climb the stairs. And it took her all of
two days to figure out how to get up to the top. She works herself up the stairs
at least twice a day and is getting pretty fast at it. She knows that I&#x02bc;m
not crazy about the idea of her going up the stairs unsupervised because she
giggles wildly when she gets to the first landing without my noticing and
scampers up the stairs if she sees me coming. (The pictures are blurry because
she&#x02bc;s *fast*.)

Now, most likely some of the more concerned readers of this blog are thinking,
&ldquo;Where *is* their baby gate?&rdquo; Simply told, we don&#x02bc;t have one.
Our metal frame banister and uneven walls have made it nearly impossible for me
to find a baby gate that we could install and operate easily. Plus, a baby gate
makes it harder for baby and Mom to get up the stairs quickly. Frankly,
I&#x02bc;m more willing to keep a close eye on her instead of fiddle with a
balky baby gate every time I need to run upstairs to get something. So. Emily
did slip down the stairs once last week and didn&#x02bc;t much like it, but
about 5 minutes later, she was back to climbing the stairs again. She&#x02bc;s a
resilient gal.

Last, I just want to say that I really like these pictures because they also
show her cute, chubby little legs. So darling!
