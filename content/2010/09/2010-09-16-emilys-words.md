This post is more for my benefit, that is, to help me remember precious things
about Emily, but feel free to keep reading if you&#x02bc;re curious.
Emily&#x02bc;s always been a chatty baby, and it&#x02bc;s fun to hear her words
start to take shape. I think she&#x02bc;s delighted that we can understand what
she&#x02bc;s saying, and I don&#x02bc;t mind it so much either. Here&#x02bc;s
some of the words that she says right now.

* Thank you (this was actually the first thing that I ever heard her articulate.
  She&#x02bc;s so polite.)
* Uh oh! (whenever she drops something or sees something on the floor that
  shouldn&#x02bc;t be there.)
* Dah! (for &ldquo;dog&rdquo;)
* Mrrrow (for &ldquo;cat&rdquo;)
* Ow! (when she bumps her head)
* Bear
* Lo (for &ldquo;hello&rdquo;)
* Ball (oh, my goodness, does she ever know this word. I can&#x02bc;t even take
  her to the toy section in Target because she starts shrieking &ldquo;Ball!
  Ball!&rdquo; whenever we get close to the cage full of bouncy balls)
* Mmm! (for something tasty)
* Ahh! (after taking a drink of water)

We&#x02bc;ve also been trying to teach her baby sign language, and she&#x02bc;s
finally getting the hang of it. She can do the signs for:

* Thank you (again, such a polite little girl)
* Bye-bye
* Bear
* Milk
* Potty
* Diaper
* Cat
* Juice
* Eat
* More
* Splash
* Bath
* Banana
* Cheerios
* Book
* Cheese
* Cookie (she&#x02bc;s definitely my child!)
* Cracker
* Finished
* Hot

Can&#x02bc;t wait to see what&#x02bc;s next!
