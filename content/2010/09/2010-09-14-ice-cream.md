We got an ice cream maker from a family that recently moved from our
neighborhood to England. I can understand why. When moving to England, one would
not want to take more than one absolutely needs. Also, the plugs are different
over there.

Rebecca identified the model number of the ice cream maker and I found the
owner&#x02bc;s manual online.

We decided to start with a recipe for vanilla ice cream. Rebecca procured the
ingredients. We mixed everything together one fine Friday evening and chilled it
in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning we churned it and let it
&ldquo;cure&rdquo; in our freezer all day.

We made six quarts and ate delicious vanilla ice cream almost every night for
two weeks.
