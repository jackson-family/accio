My awesome friend Janelle let us borrow her music table (or whatever it&#x02bc;s
really called) because her girls are too old for it and because it plays really
annoying songs. But the songs don&#x02bc;t bother me, and it keeps Emily happy.
The best thing about it is that she always dances to the music, regardless of
how educational the lyrics are. See for yourself.

Bonus: After William shot this video, he hooked our camera up to the TV so we
could watch it again. And Emily started dancing to the video of herself!
Absolutely precious.
