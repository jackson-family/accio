You may have heard about [a shooting this morning at the university where I
work][a]. For those that may be concerned, I was nowhere near the action and I
am quite safe.

For a while this morning, the campus was locked down and I was not allowed to
leave my building. My biggest fear was that I would not make it to my dentist
appointment this afternoon. But, everything cleared up and the university closed
and I got my teeth cleaned after all.
