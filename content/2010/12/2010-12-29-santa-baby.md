A few weeks ago, the mom who hosted playgroup somehow convinced Santa Claus to
come visit the kiddos. Emily is still too little to really get Christmas or
Santa or presents (though, thankfully, she does get excited about Baby Jesus).
She&#x02bc;s not one to flip out at the sight of a stranger, but she does tend
to be kind of wary, so I wasn&#x02bc;t sure how she&#x02bc;d handle her first
encounter with Santa.

Kind of suspicious of the old man with the candy cane but probably wondering if
she can pet his fur coat.

Still not convinced that she can safely take candy from strangers.\*

Will try the candy cane only if the wrapper is still on.

It was a fun outing for me, and I&#x02bc;m glad that my kid didn&#x02bc;t have a
meltdown at the sight of Santa.

\* He was the flirtiest Santa I&#x02bc;ve ever seen (maybe the only flirty Santa
I&#x02bc;ve ever seen?) He winked at me across the room *and* rubbed my back
while Emily had her picture taken. Hmm.
