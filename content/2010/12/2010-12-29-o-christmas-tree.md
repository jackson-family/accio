One of the benefits of doing a post-Christmas camera dump is that I&#x02bc;m
suddenly filled with ideas for blogs. So, here&#x02bc;s my first. For the first
time in our three years of marriage, William and I had a Christmas tree. We got
a fantastic deal at Garden Ridge during their Black Friday sale, and we had such
a hard time waiting until December to put it up. We finally opened it on the
first Monday of December as our Family Home Evening activity. It ended up taking
2 days, and hundreds of papercut-like scratches on my hands, to get the tree
fully fluffed and decorated. We&#x02bc;ve been enjoying it all month because it
fits just perfectly in our little corner. Here we are at the end of December,
and I just don&#x02bc;t want to take it down yet. Sigh.

(The last picture is here because is there anything more Christmas-y than babies
in footy pajamas?)
