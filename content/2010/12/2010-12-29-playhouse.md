In lieu of a gift exchange this year, William and I bought a chest freezer as
our Christmas present. It&#x02bc;ll go well with the Sam&#x02bc;s Club
membership that Mom and Dad gave us. Thank you!

When the freezer was delivered, I had the brilliant idea to ask the delivery guy
if we could keep the box. I wasn&#x02bc;t sure what we would do with a giant
box, but maybe Emily could play in it. My brain is pretty slow sometimes.

This is why babies need daddies, too. William turned the freezer box into a
pretty amazing little playhouse for Emily, with two windows, a swinging door,
and even a little coin slot. She&#x02bc;s spent quite a bit of time

hatching no-good plots with Daddy. I say we got our money&#x02bc;s worth out of
that box.
