Oh, goodness, I&#x02bc;m doing terribly on my New Year&#x02bc;s resolution to
write two blog posts a week. Good thing I cleaned out my camera this morning and
found a bunch of cute things to post. Here&#x02bc;s the first.

For about a month now, Emily has been obsessed with boxes, but most of all, the
box her humidifier came in. She hits it, juggles it, rubs her squeaky fingers
over it, and plays with the flaps, and it never gets old. And because I have a
very limited imagination, that&#x02bc;s all she ever did with the box. But she
was happy.

Then William took her upstairs to play one evening, and she ascended to a new,
dizzying level of fun in playing with the box.
