Remember how I&#x02bc;m jealous of my friends who have fancy cameras that take
awesome pictures of their kids? Well, my friend Tiffany actually shared her
camera with me so that I could have some cute pictures of Emily before her teeth
came in. In exchange for a sandwich, Tiffany took 672 pictures of Emily in the
comfort of my own home. I don&#x02bc;t think I even have that many pictures of
my wedding day. But here are some of my favorites from Tiffany.

Also, this picture makes me laugh because Tiffany brought her baby to the shoot,
and Emily seemed a bit taken back by this other bundle of mobile cuteness.
