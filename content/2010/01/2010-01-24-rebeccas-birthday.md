I turned 31 on Tuesday. That almost seems like a bigger milestone than 30
because now I am firmly entrenched in my 30&#x02bc;s for the next few years.
(Unless I decide to be one of those ladies that never goes past 39. We&#x02bc;ll
see.) It was a good day for me. Mom came up and took me to lunch. We had yummy
Greek food and did some shopping at Michael&#x02bc;s.

When William got home from work, I opened my presents. I got two movies from
Carrie, both of which we plan to watch a *lot*.

And William got me a cast iron skillet. Woo hoo! Now I just need to figure out
what I&#x02bc;m going to cook in it. Any suggestions?

We had our friends Paul and Erin over for a dinner with deep dish pizza, Greek
salad, and [this amazing peanut butter pie][d] that William made. So, so good!

It was a good birthday!
