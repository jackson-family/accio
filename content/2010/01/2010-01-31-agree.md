Emily has finally gotten the hang of rolling over, which William and I [both
agree upon][a]. We know this for a fact because she sometimes wakes up in the
middle of the night yelling because she&#x02bc;s found herself on her stomach
and can&#x02bc;t get back to sleep. Yes, indeed, she is rolling over from her
back to her stomach. But here&#x02bc;s a cute video of her current skills. I
love the look of accomplishment on her face. That&#x02bc;s my girl!
