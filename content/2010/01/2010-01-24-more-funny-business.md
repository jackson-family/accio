Emily was feeling really territorial of her elephant that day. They
haven&#x02bc;t had any more big fights, but I still have to keep an eye on those
two.

Emily has been working really hard on rolling over this week, and here&#x02bc;s
the look she gave me after she rolled over one afternoon. To me, it looks like
she&#x02bc;s saying, &ldquo;Yeah, I can roll over. What about it?&rdquo;
I&#x02bc;ll have to put a video up so you can see an honest rollover.

We&#x02bc;ve given Emily solid foods a few times, but right now she seems more
interested in playing with the spoon. So, I&#x02bc;ll just give her the spoon to
play with sometimes. (I hope that doesn&#x02bc;t come back to bite me in a few
months.) Anyway, she somehow managed to get the spoon stuck in her pants. And
she looks sad in this picture because I was taking her picture and she was
hungry.

Cutest picture ever. I&#x02bc;m going to be so sad when she&#x02bc;s too big for
this hat. I put her in the swing in our playset for the first time on Saturday.
She still can&#x02bc;t sit up very well, but the straps were tight enough to
keep her from slipping out. And she loved swinging! She laughed and laughed the
whole time. (It was 75 degrees outside when I took this picture, lest you worry
about her not wearing socks.)

And last. I swear William gets her into more trouble than is necessary. Here she
is trying to steal my bag of Dove chocolates, aided and abetted by William, of
course.
