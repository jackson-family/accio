This summer is the first summer in years that I&#x02bc;ve been in a position to
go to a swimming pool a lot. Living in housing without a pool, working
full-time, and being too pregnant to fit into a small piece of stretchy fabric
all have kept me from enjoying summertime as much as I would&#x02bc;ve liked,
until now.

We just got a family pass to our neighborhood pool, and it&#x02bc;s pretty much
my new favorite thing. Emily and I go to the pool at least twice a week, and we
take William swimming with us on weekends. Emily, in characteristic fashion,
shows no fear at the pool and loves being in the water. The kiddie pool is nice
because it slopes in, so she can sit up in the shallower side of the pool and
crawl around in the water to her heart&#x02bc;s content. But she most likes to
glide around in the water with my help. She&#x02bc;s quite the water baby and
even has a little tan line to prove it!

We took our camera with us to the pool yesterday, because I wanted some pictures
of Emily&#x02bc;s super-cute swimsuit, which is almost too little for her.

She&#x02bc;s such a ham when she sees us with the camera!

She keeps the little hat on pretty well, though I don&#x02bc;t know how much
good it does in keeping the sun out her eyes.

I really liked how these pictures turned out. William takes such artsy pictures!

And here we have one swimmed-out baby who slept very well last night. We love
the pool!
