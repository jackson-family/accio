I was feeding Emily a fairly messy lunch of pureed cherries (this turned out to
be a bad idea for several reasons) and decided to take her shirt off and have
her wear only the bib. I got her cleaned up at last and turned around to put
some stuff away. When I turned back to Emily, she had managed to do this to her
bib.
