Last night was our ward&#x02bc;s trunk or treat, which meant that about 70
families, complete with scary costumed kids, parked in our parking lot and
handed out candy to unsuspecting passersby. In theory this was safer than going
door to door in a strange neighborhood. But really?

It was dark, and our church parking lot is notoriously poorly lit. In true
Mormon fashion, there were harried late comers racing to enter the parking lot
which was swarming with short children. Plenty of people were wearing masks or
face wraps, despite repeated instruction not to. Kids were running everywhere,
and I imagine that parents with more than one child were having a devil of a
time keeping track of everyone. You know, with one person handing out candy at
the car, that leaves one parent to take all the kids trunk-or-treating. Emily
wanted nothing more than to run around that dark, crowded parking lot, clutching
in one hand a roll of Smarties and in the other hand a small battery. Yes, a
battery. Where on earth did she find a battery? I&#x02bc;m just glad that I
found it before she ate it. And last, this was pegged as a Fall Festival, but it
was totally a Halloween party. So, after all that, I&#x02bc;m starting to feel
pretty grinchy about Halloween.

But in case you were wondering, here&#x02bc;s what we looked like.
