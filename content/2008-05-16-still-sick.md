Today is the second consecutive day that I&#x02bc;ve stayed home sick, and
it&#x02bc;s starting to get pretty boring. This might be one of those times that
I wish we had a TV. But it&#x02bc;s really not worth the trouble, so I&#x02bc;ll
just muddle through. In case you&#x02bc;re curious, here is a list of things
that I have done to pass the time.

Yesterday:

*   Ate a breakfast taco for breakfast
*   Read more of *The Silver Chair* (Book 6 of the Narnia series)
*   Showered and fixed my hair
*   Took a 3-hour nap, had very vivid dreams about Narnia, and totally smushed
    my hair
*   Wrote a blog post
*   Checked out Facebook (Sarah, it&#x02bc;s your turn again on Scrabulous!)
*   Called my mom
*   Had a giant bowl of cookies and cream ice cream for lunch
*   Chatted with Carrie and William for a while
*   Watched *Bride and Prejudice* with William

Today:

*   Finished *The Silver Chair*
*   Showered (I believe that no matter how sick you are, if you&#x02bc;re able
    to do so, you should take a shower because it just makes you feel a little
    bit better)
*   Chatted with William
*   Went to HEB to get buns for dinner
*   Picked up a Citrus Squeeze Jamba Juice (When I&#x02bc;m sick, I crave Jamba
    Juice. Good thing there are 2 locations down the road from us!)
*   Went to the library to pick up a book I&#x02bc;d ordered and came home with
    four books. Uh oh.

And it&#x02bc;s not even 2:00 yet. No telling what kinds of mischief I&#x02bc;ll
get into by the time William gets home.

And for those of you who are worried about me &mdash; mostly my mom and dad
&mdash; I do think I&#x02bc;m getting better. I sure hope that I am, because I
want to see William graduate tomorrow!
