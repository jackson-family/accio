Today Rebecca took Emily and me to the [Red Barn Garden Center][a] because they
advertised a petting zoo and pumpkin patch! Most of the vegetables in our garden
came from Red Barn.

When we got there we wandered around for a while before finding the animals all
the way in the back. On the way to the animals, Emily reminded us that most
vegetables, especially pumpkins, look suspiciously like a &ldquo;ball&rdquo;.

Emily liked the guineas, ducklings, chicks, and rabbits, but mostly she liked
the guinea pig that jumped every time she touched it. I had to remind her that
it was a petting zoo, not a poking zoo. There was also a horse and two donkeys,
but they were boring.

There were plenty of opportune places for family photographs. We had a wonderful
time!
