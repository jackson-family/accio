On Friday night, William and I were in Borders trying to use our $50 worth of
gift cards. (That&#x02bc;s not really the point of this story, but we did come
home with *Fellowship of the Ring* on DVD.) William was showing me this
particular line of computer books that he likes. They&#x02bc;re published by
O&#x02bc;Reilly, and it&#x02bc;s a series of guidebooks to various programming
languages and operating systems. Each book has a pen and ink sketch of an animal
on the cover.

My office is finally upgrading to Windows Vista sometime in the next month, and
I know very, very little about what we&#x02bc;re getting into. So, I picked up
the O&#x02bc;Reilly guide to Vista and started flipping through it. I figured
out quickly that I wouldn&#x02bc;t find it very helpful because it had too much
text and not enough illustrations. I commented to William, &ldquo;This book
wouldn&#x02bc;t help me at all. I need more pictures.&rdquo; My sweet husband
responded, &ldquo;Hmmm. You need &hellip; *Windows Vista for Dummies*.&rdquo;

And that, my friends, is the stuff of which happy marriages are made.
