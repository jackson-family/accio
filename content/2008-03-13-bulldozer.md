Last Saturday, William and I spent the afternoon in New Braunfels with my
family. Our nephews John and Jacob also were there visiting Grandma and Pop. We
took the boys for a walk in the neighborhood because it was such a nice
afternoon. And we found a bulldozer!

Mom and I took turns pushing Jacob, but I think he would much rather have been
walking. But he&#x02bc;ll learn someday that sometimes it&#x02bc;s nice to have
someone else push you up a big hill instead of walking it.

John wouldn&#x02bc;t go near the bulldozer until I sat down here.

John had a big old time driving the bulldozer and honking its horn.

Jacob put this Frisbee over his head to block the sun. Such a smart kid!

And of course, William didn&#x02bc;t want to miss out on the fun, either.
