Rebecca and I love to work in the kitchen together. We have been cooking buddies
since before we were engaged. We love to try new things, or throw together old
favorites. But recently, Rebecca has learned something interesting:

Good Things Happen when you leave William alone in the kitchen.

I enjoy occasionally getting up early and making breakfast before Rebecca gets
out of bed. This morning I tried my hand at Cinnamon Raisin Biscuits (from *The
Ultimate Southern Living Cookbook*). They turned out great and Rebecca loved
them!

I&#x02bc;m worried this is turning into a food blog.
