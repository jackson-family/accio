I truly have a wonderful wife. Rebecca makes me so happy.

Yesterday (i.e. Valentine&#x02bc;s Day) I didn&#x02bc;t get home until 19:30 on
account of it was a Thursday and I have a class on Thursday that doesn&#x02bc;t
end until 6:45 and the bus comes at 6:53 and the bus takes 35 minutes to get to
my home.

Rebecca had been advertising something called &ldquo;A Valentine&#x02bc;s Day
Extravaganza&rdquo; for over a week now, and I didn&#x02bc;t really know what to
expect. When I got home and opened the door the most amazing aroma entered my
nose; it was an olfactory sensation not easily rivaled. Rebecca was barely
finishing dinner.

And do you know what she did?

A few weeks ago Rebecca and I ate out at [Buca di Beppo][a] and we had, among
other things, something called &ldquo;Chicken Saltimbocca&rdquo; described thus:

<blockquote class="blockquote pl-3 border-left">
	<p>Chicken Saltimbocca: Juicy saut√©ed chicken breasts, layered with fresh
	sage and prosciutto, and topped with artichoke hearts, capers and our
	delicate lemon butter sauce.</p>
</blockquote>

Well, I loved it so much and for Valentine&#x02bc;s Day Rebecca recreated this
meal for us! And it was so much more delicious than I remembered it being. And
we had fettuccine alfredo and asparagus (yum!) and ciabatta bread for good
measure.

My wife is amazing.
