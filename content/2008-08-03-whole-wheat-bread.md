Another attempt at bread. This time we used 100% whole wheat flour. We made it
on Saturday and already tried a slice, which was very good. But this will teach
me not to make bread the day before Fast Sunday ever again.

This recipe was easy. Just throw all the ingredients together and mix. Knead
eight minutes and let rise an hour. Shape into a log and put it in the loaf pan.
Let rise another hour, then bake at 350 &deg;F for forty minutes (cover with
foil after the first twenty minutes).

It tastes better if you go swimming while the bread is rising. Speaking from
personal experience.

The full recipe is [on the King Arthur Flour website][a].
