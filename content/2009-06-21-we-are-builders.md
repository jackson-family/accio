Rebecca and I spent Saturday morning and early afternoon building our new
kitchen table. Here is a 6000+ word essay describing this adventure:

The table came in two boxes, helpfully labeled &ldquo;1&rdquo; and
&ldquo;2&rdquo;. We are thoughtful, plan-ahead types, so we deliberately opened
box 1 first. It seemed like the numerically obvious place to start. Lest you
think this was going to be a straightforward operation, there were no
instructions in box 1.

Thankfully, we found the instructions in box 2. If we hadn&#x02bc;t, I
don&#x02bc;t know where we would have looked. Here Rebecca is having a good
laugh at the funny Swedish people.

Perhaps &ldquo;2&rdquo; is Swedish for &ldquo;one&rdquo;?

It turns out kitchen tables are not made of wood and nothing else. We counted
all the hardware pieces before we started &mdash; for we are thoughtful,
plan-ahead types &mdash; and came up short one wooden dowel. After a very short,
possibly frantic search, we found it *inside* that funny metal t-shaped tool.

We found it difficult to imagine how a pile of wood and several dozen screws
could actually be turned into a table, but we plodded along, carefully following
the instructions, and the table began to take shape.

Then we found out what the funny metal t-shaped tool was for: attaching the legs
to the table! Those funny Swedes think of everything, don&#x02bc;t they?

The table came with two extensions that hide under the top when not in use, and
fit into the middle when in use. With both extensions, the table looks
*impossibly* long. We might be able to seat my entire immediate family around
it.

At least now we can seat more than four people at a time! Would you like to come
over for dinner?

Of course, if you *would* like to come over, you will be required to put
together your own chair first. I hope you can read Swedish!
