It is no secret that Rebecca and I like picking berries together. In March of
2007, we went to [Sweet Berry Farm][a] in Marble Falls, Texas (west of Austin)
to pick strawberries. We had such a wonderful time (I did, at least) that I
dubbed it &ldquo;The Perfect Day&rdquo;.

Then in May of 2007, we went back to the same farm to pick blackberries. That
was the day I told Rebecca I intended to put a ring on her finger. Quite
memorable.

Last March (2008) we returned to Sweet Berry Farm in Marble Falls and picked
strawberries once again. This time it had recently rained, it was much muddier,
but the strawberries were just as delicious as we remembered.

Now we find ourselves in the month of May, and today is the day we chose to pick
blackberries. Sweet Berry Farm operates another farm in Lexington, Texas (east
of Austin), so we decided to branch out and see how the blackberries were at the
Lexington farm. We were not disappointed!

The farm at Lexington is smaller than the one at Marble Falls, but that means
less people. The blackberries were abundant and delicious. The drive was
pleasant, but I will admit it was not as pretty as the drive to Marble Falls, in
my opinion. But we got to stop in Elgin on the way back for &ldquo;[the best
tasting sausage in the free world][b]&rdquo;.

Other things we did today:

*   We shopped at the Boy Scouts of America shop because I was recently called
    as an 11-year-old Scout Leader in my ward and I needed a new shirt and a new
    book.
*   I had an eye exam and we picked out new glasses for me because it has been
    five years since my last exam and I lost my glasses a week ago. Well, I know
    exactly where I put them: on the seat next to me on the bus. I just
    didn&#x02bc;t pick them up again before I got off the bus.
*   We bought beach towels because we plan to do some serious swimming (read
    *lounging*) in our apartment complex pool this summer.
*   We lounged in our apartment complex pool for a while.

Today was a good day.
