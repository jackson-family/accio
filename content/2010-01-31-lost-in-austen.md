Thanks to my friend Rachel, William and I recently watched a British miniseries
called [_Lost in Austen_][a]. I&#x02bc;d recommend it to any _Pride and
Prejudice_ fan with a caveat not to take it too seriously. To summarize,
it&#x02bc;s about an ardent admirer (smirk smirk) of _Pride and Prejudice_
named Amanda who finds a portal into Regency England, smack dab in the middle of
the plot of the book. Amanda somehow manages to screw up the entire plot of
_Pride and Prejudice_ and spends the next 2.5 hours trying in vain to correct
it. You know, things like Jane marrying Mr. Collins, Mr. Wickham turning out to
be completely adorable, and Mr. Bingley becoming a mopey drunk. Things get
pretty confused, and any fan of the book probably can&#x02bc;t help but feel a
little forlorn to see the classic story twisted so far.

After we finally finished watching it, after all the plot twists and turns and
surprising endings, William turned to me and sighed, &ldquo;I think I need to
watch _Pride and Prejudice_ again, just so I know that all is right with the
world.&rdquo; How can I not love this guy?

PS: There is a great scene that spoofs Colin Firth&#x02bc;s famous wet shirt
scene from the BBC miniseries, which is by far the cleverest part in the whole
show.
