A few months ago, William told me that he had never been to the Alamo. Of
course, I was aghast, immediately thinking that the Texas public education
system had somehow failed him by never taking him on a field trip to San
Antonio, which was a staple of my early years of schooling. One thing that I
have wanted to do since high school is attend the [Texas Folklife Festival][a],
which is put on every year by the Institute of Texan Cultures. And so, I thought
that I might kill two birds with one stone by planning a weekend trip that would
incorporate both of our needs.

So, I decided that I would surprise him by planning a weekend getaway to San
Antonio, filled with all of the touristy staples: dinner at the
[Tower of the Americas][b], a walk along the Riverwalk (Paseo del Rio, if you
want to be fancy pants about it), a stop at the Alamo, and a good part of the
day at the Texas Folklife Festival. I found a great hotel downtown, the
[O&#x02bc;Brien][c], and got a good deal on Travelocity. We pre-ordered tickets
for the Folklife Festival. I made a dinner reservation. All of our plans came
together to make for the perfect weekend.

We both were able to leave work early on Friday, so we made it to San Antonio in
great time. As I was checking into our hotel, I met some *very* friendly people
from Las Vegas who had spent the afternoon drinking cocktails, and one of whom
introduced herself as part of a &ldquo;drinking club with a diving
problem.&rdquo; (Apparently, this group gets together every Friday the 13th and
goes diving somewhere in the country. And this weekend they were in San
Antonio.) We had a bit of time before our dinner reservation, so we watched *The
Simpsons*. And then we dressed and headed over to the Tower of the Americas.

The Tower of the Americas was built for the Hemisfair in 1968, and now
it&#x02bc;s just a distinguishing feature on the San Antonio skyline.
There&#x02bc;s a restaurant at top, the [Chart House][d]. For those who
don&#x02bc;t want to pay for dinner, they can pay to take the elevator to the
observation deck. However, as we figured out, I don&#x02bc;t know what would
stop you from declaring an intention to eat at the restaurant, taking the
elevator up for free and then &ldquo;changing your mind.&rdquo; Anyway. The
other thing about the restaurant is that the tower rotates slowly (approximately
one revolution per hour). So, you get a panoramic view of San Antonio while you
eat &mdash; very nice! We had a delicious dinner. We had this gooey crab,
shrimp, and cheese fondue for an appetizer and then I had red snapper, and
William had halibut. So, so tasty! I need to learn how to make fish like that.

Then we went up to the observation deck and got completely windswept and giggly.
The wind blows so hard up there! At one point, I even had to check to make sure
my rings hadn&#x02bc;t gotten sucked off. We tried to see the San Antonio Temple
off to the north, but the sky was too hazy. Maybe if it had been darker &hellip;

I must add that the only thing that marred our evening was the fact that I chose
to wear my hot gold shoes to dinner and had to walk all the way to the Tower and
back in them. By the time we got to the Tower, my feet were already starting to
blister, and I knew that walking back to the hotel would be difficult. In fact,
at one point during our walk back, William suggested that I take my shoes off
and walk barefoot. It was more comfortable to walk on burning hot pavement
barefoot than it was to wear those shoes. But I still looked really hot. So.

We made it back to the hotel, slipped into the complimentary bathrobes, and
watched the end of _Pride and Prejudice_ on the Oxygen channel. It all felt so
luxurious.
