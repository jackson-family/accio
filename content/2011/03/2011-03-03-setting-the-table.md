Last night, Emily busied herself while I was making dinner. I was a bit
preoccupied and didn&#x02bc;t notice what she was up to until about halfway
through the project. But this is the final result, and I think it is
heart-breakingly precious.

A few answers to questions that you might have.

*   Those are cork trivets from IKEA, which are far less breakable than real
    plates. Emily is obsessed with them right now and is just tall enough to
    reach into the drawer to pull them out. One of them has a small
    (Emily-sponsored) bite out of it.
*   Yes, there are two forks for me and William. Because you can eat a lot
    faster if you have a fork in each hand.
*   Yes, she arranged everything there all by herself. I handed her the plastic
    cups but that was the extent of my assistance.

Not bad for an 18-month old!
