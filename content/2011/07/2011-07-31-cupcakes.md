A while back, I bought a Groupon-type deal for a class at a local bake shop,
thinking that with kids, knowing a little bit about decorating cakes would be a
good thing. I managed to convince my friend to sign up for a cupcake class with
me, but then she backed out at the last minute. (For a very good reason, so no
hard feelings there.) The whole point of going with someone else was to have
another person to laugh with if my creations came out looking like
[Cake Wrecks][a].

But I&#x02bc;m pleased to report that my cupcake attempts came out looking
reasonably edible. We had a good instructor who walked us through every step of
the process. Her assistant set out all the supplies as we worked through the
sequence of designs. And each cupcake was supposed to teach a different
technique or decorating material, so we had a pretty good introduction to some
of the different decorations out there.

The finished collection of my dozen cupcakes:

The hamburgers and hot dogs are made out of chocolate fondant:

Good old-fashioned cupcake with sprinkles:

One of my favorite designs to make, and it was easier than it looks. Dip the
center in sprinkles and pipe yellow petals all around. Ta da!

I loved this gold sparkling sugar so much:

This looks so much fancier than it is. Turns out fondant is incredibly easy to
work with.

Emily&#x02bc;s birthday is coming up in just a few weeks, and now I have so many
ideas for her cupcakes. Where to start??
