I was in charge of picking a site for playgroup this week and decided to have the group meet at [Pioneer Farms][a].
Emily has long been obsessed with animals from her books and all the versions of &ldquo;Old MacDonald&rdquo; that we can
possibly produce (did you know that he sometimes has a mouse, a frog, popcorn, and a baby on his farm, too?) I thought
it was high time that she meet some honest to goodness farm animals, and Pioneer Farms did not disappoint. We met up
with a few other friends and their kids and had a fabulous time exploring and enjoying the perfect 70 degree January
day. Ahhh.

Non plussed by the cows. They mooed and she blinked at them.

She was pretty interested in the chickens, probably because they are just the right size for chasing. It didn&#x02bc;t
come to that, but I could tell that she really wanted to get her hands on those feathers.

Still trying to get into the chicken cage!

This sequence of pictures makes me laugh. I can&#x02bc;t believe Emily was brave enough to pet the donkey!

Looks like the donkey liked having his nose scratched, much to Emily&#x02bc;s surprise

Is it just me, or do the donkeys look like they&#x02bc;re smirking in the next two pictures?

Sometimes, being a mom is pretty fun.
