As part of William&#x02bc;s birthday celebration in March, we took Emily to see
the San Antonio Temple.

We had a nice visit, and hopefully she stopped running around just long enough
to actually look at the temple.

At least now she knows that if a building has Moroni on it, it&#x02bc;s a
temple. Good start, right?
