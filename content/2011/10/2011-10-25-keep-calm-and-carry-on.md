At the outbreak of the Second World War, the British government produced a
series of posters intended to raise morale in the event of an invasion or other
wartime disaster. This is one of those posters:

You don&#x02bc;t need a war to appreciate the wise counsel here. We have little
disasters every day that, in hindsight, are revealed as the inconsequential
hiccups they really are. But when you are in the thick of life, when your
daughter is pushing all your buttons, it can be hard to keep perspective.

So, to help us keep perspective, we have this poster on the wall in our home.
When our little corner of the world is in turmoil, we can take a step back, take
a deep breath, keep calm and carry on. In a day, a week, a year or five, we can
look back and laugh about that silly thing Emily did that frustrated us so.

But until then, take a step back, take a deep breath, keep calm and carry on.
