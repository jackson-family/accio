My grandmother turned 85 in December, so my aunt Kay decided that she needed a
birthday celebration befitting 85 well-lived years. She arranged for an organ
recital at the First United Methodist Church in New Braunfels to be performed by
her own church organist who is, as we all recently learned for ourselves,
supremely talented. The celebration was last weekend &mdash; I&#x02bc;m just
slow in getting this posted. We all gathered in New Braunfels for the
festivities: family dinner on Saturday night at Montana Mike&#x02bc;s
restaurant, birthday cake for Grandmother (and everyone else who had a birthday
in the December&ndash;January period) at my parents&#x02bc; house, organ recital
on Sunday afternoon at the Methodist Church, and another family dinner after the
recital.

My uncle Jim and his family flew in from California, my aunt Carol and her
family came from Arlington, and of course, my dad and mom were there, too.
It&#x02bc;s very rare that Grandmother has all four of her children together at
the same time, so this was a very special treat for her!

The organ recital was fantastic. I usually think the organ is kind of a boring
and dreary instrument, but the organist was so good that we all were wide awake
the whole time. She played the famous Toccata and Fugue of B-movie horror flick
fame, along with the Navy hymn, in honor of all the Navy men in the family, and
good old church hymns.

The other special part of the day is that Aunt Kay arranged for everyone to
write a letter to Grandmother, and she collected all of those letters into a
scrapbook, along with pictures. It looked like quite the production, and
Grandmother should enjoy reading through it again and again.

And here are a few pictures. Here&#x02bc;s Grandmother holding up her scrapbook.
The little girl on the cover is her at a very young age.
