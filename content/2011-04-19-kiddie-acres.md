A few weeks ago, my sister-in-law Monica and her youngest, Ryan, showed up at my
house and basically begged us to go have some fun with them. She had tickets to
a little amusement park nearby that were expiring, and she wanted some company.
So, I quickly cleaned up my garden tools and gave Emily a snack, and then we
were off to Kiddie Acres!

(I mention &ldquo;garden tools&rdquo; because I&#x02bc;d planned to spend the
morning working in my garden. I hadn&#x02bc;t showered and didn&#x02bc;t have
time change before we met up at Kiddie Acres. That&#x02bc;s why my pictures look
kind of &hellip; er &hellip; awesome?)

We&#x02bc;ve driven past Kiddie Acres many times, and I&#x02bc;ve always thought
that it looks kind of scary, like the amusement park in _Pinocchio_. So, I
didn&#x02bc;t think it would be a nice place to take Emily. Turns out I was
mostly wrong. Well, it is kind of scary even up close because everything needs a
paint job, but the rides are fun for toddlers. Emily was able to try out pretty
much every mode of transportation that day.

		tripping and bumping her head on the snack cup she was carrying. It
		looks worse than it was, but it&#x02bc;s taken a surprisingly long time
		to clear up, i.e. as of writing this post, she still has a red smudge on
		her cheek.)

And this last picture, I&#x02bc;m throwing it in because it&#x02bc;s classic
Ryan telling Emily what to do. He&#x02bc;s 7.5 months older than her and gets
bossed around a lot at home, I think. So, he was more than happy to do the
bossing for a change.

Thanks to Monica and Ryan for a fun family outing!
