My sister-in-law Monica has a fancy camera that has a fast enough shutter-speed
to capture wiggly children and babies. So, I asked her to do newborn pictures of
Molly. Of course, by the time that we could find a day that worked for both of
us, Molly wasn&#x02bc;t especially newborn but 1 month old. But close enough,
right? Here are a few of my favorites.

We have a picture of Emily where she looks almost exactly like this. Definitely
sisters!

And for good measure, I asked for a shot of me with my girls. Love, love, love
this picture! We&#x02bc;re all so photogenic here.

Thanks again to Monica for the fun pictures!
