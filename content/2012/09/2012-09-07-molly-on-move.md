I was looking through my blogs, and it appears that the last post I wrote about
Molly is called &ldquo;Molly&#x02bc;s Newborn Photos.&rdquo; Well. That is kind
of embarrassing because she will be nine months old next week. She is no longer
a newborn. In fact, she is so much more than a newborn because now she can do
this.

Yep, that&#x02bc;s her charging up the stairs for the first time ever. And in
true Molly fashion, there was no hesitation. Once the idea was in her head, she
was determined to make it happen, and she did. Do you like how the picture is
blurry? That is because she is fast!

Yesterday, Molly decided to spice things up a little with her exersaucer. The
view must be more interesting from the bottom. She crawled right in all by
herself and had a good time playing in her little hideout.

That&#x02bc;s my Jolly Molly for you!
