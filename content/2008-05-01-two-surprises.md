Today, when I got home from work, this is what I found outside of our apartment.
No explanation attached, just a piece of heavy equipment parked in my usual
parking space.

Tonight, when I got home from Enrichment, I found these on the kitchen table.
Again, no explanation. (But I suspect William.)

And this is a picture that I took with the close up feature on our camera, just
to play around with it. I think it turned out nicely!
