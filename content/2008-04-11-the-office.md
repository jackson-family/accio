For you fans of NBC&#x02bc;s amazingly funny show *The Office*, here&#x02bc;s a
fun little quiz: [http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/14049][a]</a>. I got
14 out of 18 questions, which makes me a solid C student of *The Office*.

Oh, and I took a personality quiz to find out which *Office* character
I&#x02bc;m most like, and I got Pam. Whew. What if I&#x02bc;d turned out to be
most like Creed?
