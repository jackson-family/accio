When I turned two years old I received a [Glo Worm][a] as a gift. I just learned
today that the Glo Worm was first released the same year I was born, making it a
fitting gift indeed.

What went through my mind as I hugged my new friend? Did I ever, in my wildest
two-year-old dreams, consider that this very scene would be played out with
uncanny similarity a quarter of a century later? Certainly not.

Even the green clothes match rather well. I am sure I felt about as much
happiness as a two-year-old could feel when I hugged my little Glo Worm. I know
I felt the same way when I held little Emily, too.
