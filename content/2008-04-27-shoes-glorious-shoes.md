For those of you who are wondering how successful our stop at TJ Maxx was, I
present the following photos.

		These are my sensible &ldquo;I need some comfy shoes that I can put on
		in a hurry without looking like I got dressed in a hurry&rdquo; shoes.
		Very comfy!

		These are where things started getting exciting. I don&#x02bc;t know
		where I&#x02bc;m going to wear these shoes, but they were too cute to
		pass up. These are my &ldquo;I need some comfy shoes that I can put on
		in a hurry that aren&#x02bc;t brown sandals&rdquo; shoes.

		And finally, we have these incredible gold shoes. I don&#x02bc;t know
		what to say about them, except that I fell in love with these shoes.
		Well, as much in love as one can fall with a pair of shoes. I cannot
		wait to wear these. These will be my &ldquo;Yes, I really am wearing
		gold high heels in public just because I can&rdquo; shoes.

		And I found a swimsuit. It was $14, it doesn&#x02bc;t plunge down to my
		belly button, and the little skirt on the bottom covers up just about
		everything around my waist and hips that I want to hide. Who
		would&#x02bc;ve guessed that such a gem could be found at TJ Maxx, of
		all places? Now, I&#x02bc;m actually excited to go swimming!

If only I could wear my new swimsuit and my gold shoes to the pool &hellip;
