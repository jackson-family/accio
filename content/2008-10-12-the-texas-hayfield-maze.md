On Saturday Rebecca and I went to [Sweet Berry Farm][a] in Marble Falls, Texas.
We got a lift on a hayride to the [Texas Maze][b]. This is a huge
&ldquo;hayfield maze&rdquo; shaped like Texas.

The point of the maze is to go in, find nine points that represent the
geographical locations of certain Texas cities, and punch a hole in a card with
the hole puncher at each point. If one found every city, one got a free drink
when one came out.

We probably spent close to an hour searching for cities, and we came out once to
consult the map for a few cities that we couldn&#x02bc;t find at first.
Rebecca&#x02bc;s mother Ann called me (probably because Rebecca did not have her
phone with her) and asked me where we were.

&ldquo;We are lost in a giant maze the shape of Texas,&rdquo; I replied.

With Ann&#x02bc;s well-wishes, we succeeded in the end and Rebecca got her
bottle of water and I got my pink lemonade.
