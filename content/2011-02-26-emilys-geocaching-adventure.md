Today Rebecca went to a Women&#x02bc;s Conference at church, so Emily and I went
on a father-daughter date to the park. I invited some other fathers in the
neighborhood, but nobody else could make it. But that&#x02bc;s okay!

The last time I took Emily to the park, I tried to find [a geocache][a]. I
couldn&#x02bc;t find it. But I read a few comments by some people that found it
in the past, and I decided to try again.

Today Emily and I found it!

We decided to take a walk down to the duck pond to try for another cache. We
were feeling lucky! Also, Emily really wanted to &ldquo;See ducks!&rdquo; She
repeated that phrase all the way to the pond. Except for when a dog passed us;
then it was &ldquo;Hi, dog! Bye dog!&rdquo;

We also saw several bicycles. Emily calls them &ldquo;sickle&rdquo;, and
whenever I try to tell her to call it a &ldquo;bicycle&rdquo;, she says,
&ldquo;Bye bye, sickle!&rdquo;

We made it to the duck pond and we found [the second geocache][b], too! We did a
good job today.
