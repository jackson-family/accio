We like it when folks come to dinner at our house, and there&#x02bc;s a standing
invitation for anyone who&#x02bc;s coming to Austin for any period of time. On
Monday, Dave and Chelsea (William&#x02bc;s brother and sister-in-law) and
Bentley, their toddler with the English rock star name, had dinner with us. And
it was so fun to hang out with them because all the other times that
we&#x02bc;ve been with them (well, me, at least) we&#x02bc;ve been at a wedding
and it&#x02bc;s not really easy to talk at those, especially when it&#x02bc;s
yours. Anyway, we loved having them and wish that they lived closer so we could
see them more often. (Hey, Chelsea &mdash; Costco is just down the street! Hint
hint.) And here&#x02bc;s the standard couch picture that we take with our
guests.
