When we moved into our house over a year ago, our bedroom walls were just some
standard, boring white color. We weren&#x02bc;t sure what we wanted to do with
them, so we waited.

And waited. And waited.

Then about a month ago, suddenly, Rebecca knew what color she wanted to paint
our bedroom. Yesterday we painted the walls in our bedroom [<strike>Lyndhurst
Gallery Beige</strike> Gallery Grey][a].

The pictures don&#x02bc;t do it justice. You will have to take a closer look the
next time you are visiting.
