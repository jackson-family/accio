Yesterday morning (25 April) as I was driving to work,
[listening to Morning Edition on NPR][a], I learned that April is
[National Poetry Month][b], and today (26 April) is
[Poem in Your Pocket Day][c].

> The idea is simple: select a poem you love during National Poetry Month then
> carry it with you to share with co-workers, family, and friends.

I honestly was not expecting what happened next. As I started to consider
whether I wanted to participate, and if so, what poem I would pick, I remembered
that 26 April is also my mother&#x02bc;s birthday. She would have turned 59
today.

My thoughts immediately turned to a poem that was fresh on my mind because it
figures prominently in a book I read recently: [_Crossed_][d], by Ally Condie.
This is the poem I want to share with you.

[_Crossing the Bar_][e], by Alfred Tennyson

> Sunset and evening star,  
> &nbsp; And one clear call for me!  
> And may there be no moaning of the bar,  
> &nbsp; When I put out to sea,

> But such a tide as moving seems asleep,  
> &nbsp; Too full for sound and foam,  
> When that which drew from out the boundless deep  
> &nbsp; Turns again home.

> Twilight and evening bell,  
> &nbsp; And after that the dark!  
> And may there be no sadness of farewell,  
> &nbsp; When I embark;

> For tho&#x02bc; from out our bourne of Time and Place  
> &nbsp; The flood may bear me far,  
> I hope to see my Pilot face to face  
> &nbsp; When I have crost the bar.

After I made the connection between the poem and my mother, I began to cry. This
was the first time I have cried about my mother since she passed away last
summer. I&#x02bc;m sure she hoped for a lot of things, and I bet one of them
was, &ldquo;And may there be no sadness of farewell, / When I embark;&rdquo;.

But these were no tears of sadness. My mother followed that one clear call
echoing out from the boundless deep, and she has turned again home. I know she
has now seen her Pilot face to face, as we all will one day.
