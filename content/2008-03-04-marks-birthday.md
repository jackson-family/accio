Today is my brother Mark&#x02bc;s 28<sup>th</sup> birthday. Having just
completed Year 28 myself, I can tell him that 28 is a pretty exciting age.

These are some things that you may wish to know about Mark.

1.  He speaks Spanish really well because he served his mission in the Dominican
    Republic, majored in Latin American Studies at UT, and then worked for Dell
    Latin America for 2 years.
2.  He is really funny and has a contagious laugh, especially when watching a
    funny TV show like *Most Extreme Sports Challenge*.
3.  He can work wonders with a weed whacker.
4.  He can do a 360 dunk. Maybe.
5.  He is really tall. I like that all the men in my family are tall.
6.  He is a good daddy. His boys both adore him, and it&#x02bc;s sweet to watch
    them all play together.
7.  I have his birthday present at my house, and it&#x02bc;s a good one.

Anyway, here&#x02bc;s a birthday wish to him from us.
