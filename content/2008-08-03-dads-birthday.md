I was just looking at the pictures from Dad&#x02bc;s birthday party a few
weekends ago and thought that I should post these pictures because they are just
classic pictures of my family.

First, does anyone else fear for John&#x02bc;s next sibling, based on this
picture? We might need to review &ldquo;baby holding&rdquo; skills soon &hellip;

Carrie and Mom made these cupcakes for John. They *made* them, using muffins,
Twinkies, and frosting! I like them because they look like the nicest, politest
sharks in the world, kind of like something you&#x02bc;d see in a Far Side
cartoon.

And it looks like John really enjoyed his cupcake. Sometimes, I miss being a
kid.

Here&#x02bc;s the banana nut cake that I made for Dad. The frosting was a little
runny, so I drizzled it artfully instead of actually frosting the cake. Mmm.

Here&#x02bc;s Dad on what appears to be his third birthday, if the candles are
any indication of his true age.

Jacob was pretty excited about the presents and started opening them before Dad
could get to them.

Gotta love those family get-togethers!
