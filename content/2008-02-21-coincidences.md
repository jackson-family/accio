I&#x02bc;ve been meaning to write this post for a few weeks now, ever since I
found out that my good friend [Janae][a] whom I worked with in Washington DC in
the summer of 2003 was in my Political Science 110 class at BYU in the fall of
2000. We were in the same class and never met! And then we worked together in DC
three years later and became practically BFF. So, I&#x02bc;ve been thinking a
lot about random people who have come into my life and people who know someone
that I know and just all of the funny ways that people are connected. Here are a
few other instances of how life is funny like that.

1.  We had the missionaries over last week, and one of them has an unusual
    Finnish last name. I couldn&#x02bc;t figure out why his last name sounded
    familiar, so he and I played the &ldquo;Do I know you from somewhere?&rdquo;
    game, and we figured out that his older sister had been in one of my BYU
    wards.
2.  When I left BYU and Provo in 2004, I figured that I was saying goodbye to a
    bunch of good friends that I would probably never see again and almost
    certainly never live in close proximity to. One of those friends that I left
    behind was my good friend and roommate Liz with whom I would stay up late on
    Friday night and talk about life and why we were probably never going to get
    married and all of the things that we could give up for Lent if we had been
    Catholic. And last summer, much to my surprise and delight, she and her
    husband got transferred to Austin, of all places, for his job, and they live
    20 minutes away from us. I&#x02bc;m so happy that they are here!
3.  When William and I were in San Francisco, we took a bus down Haight Street
    to Golden Gate Park, and I remembered that I had been an undergraduate
    classics student with a girl whose last name was Haight. I hadn&#x02bc;t
    thought about her in at least 4 years but remembered that she had been
    really, really smart. The next Sunday we attended our new ward, and it turns
    out that Iantha Haight and her new husband had just moved into our ward as
    well. (I do this a lot, where I&#x02bc;ll remember someone that I
    haven&#x02bc;t seen in a while, and then I will hear from them or see them
    like 3 days later.) And the best part of this story is that Iantha&#x02bc;s
    parents just moved into my parents&#x02bc; ward in New Braunfels!
4.  My last roommate Elizabeth and I met my first Sunday in Austin in the summer
    of 2004. We both thought that the other looked vaguely familiar but
    couldn&#x02bc;t figure it out other than that we had met somewhere at BYU.
    And then 2 years later, we moved into a house together and had so much fun
    as roommates for the next year and a half. But we still haven&#x02bc;t
    figured out how we know each other. It&#x02bc;s almost comical, really.
5.  (This one is mostly for Sarah.) In the summer of 2004, I took an accelerated
    Spanish class at BYU, and it was a class that met from 8-12 every morning.
    In such an intense environment, you learn to love or hate the people
    you&#x02bc;re surrounded by. Luckily, I bonded with a few people from that
    class, including a fellow Texan, Ammon Franklin. He used to complain that he
    wasn&#x02bc;t really from Waco, Texas but that his parents had moved there
    without his permission and forced a new hometown upon him. Anyway, our
    teacher was talking to us after class one day, and Ammon was talking about
    how he had a hard time asking girls out because he didn&#x02bc;t have a car.
    So, I (in a moment of foolish generosity) said that I would let him borrow
    my car the next weekend for whatever date he went on. And he took me up on
    the offer and we were friends after that. (Also, Ammon had done a study
    abroad in Egypt with my friend Robert.) Several years later, William and I
    were talking one day, and I asked him whether he knew Ammon Franklin. He
    said that Ammon had been in his ward in Waco, so I told him my car story. He
    later asked Ammon if he remembered me from his Spanish class at BYU, and
    Ammon said that he had no idea who I was. I find this slightly
    disappointing.

Does anyone else have stories like this?
