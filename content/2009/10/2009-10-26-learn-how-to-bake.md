On Saturday, Mom and I went to San Antonio for a cooking demonstration sponsored
by [King Arthur Flour Company][a]. (I love these people. They have fool-proof
recipes, and their blog has so much good information for baking all kinds of
breads.) I&#x02bc;ve had it on my calendar for a few months and had really been
looking forward to seeing it. The demonstration was on &ldquo;Sweet Yeasted
Breads.&rdquo;

Except for two little kids there, I was easily the youngest person in
attendance. Does that mean that people my age aren&#x02bc;t that keen on baking?
Sad! I had to laugh when the instructor asked, &ldquo;How many of you are
comfortable making yeast breads?&rdquo; and about half of us raised our hands. I
wonder if she was thinking, &ldquo;Then why are you here?&rdquo; But we had a
good time all the same and managed to learn a few new things. The instructor
made a basic sweet dough and then showed us how to shape a mock braid with
poppyseed filling and a pan of sweet rolls.

The best part about the demonstration was the door prizes. Mom won a bag of 100%
Organic Bread Flour, and I&#x02bc;m sure she&#x02bc;ll find something tasty to
make with that. Everyone in attendance received a recipe booklet from King
Arthur Flour, a coupon for a bag of flour, recipes from Argos Baking Powder and
Cabot Cheese company, a bowl scraper, and a $10 gift card for King Arthur
products.

And using the recipe that was demonstrated, I was able to make these last night.
Mmm.
