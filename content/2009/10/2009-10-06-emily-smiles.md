Emily&#x02bc;s smile is starting to shine through. She&#x02bc;s most smiley in
the mornings when she&#x02bc;s fully awake (it sometimes takes her a few minutes
to wake up, just like her dad.) Anyway, this video shows you how the smile comes
out: she looks a little grumpy and confused and then all of a sudden,
she&#x02bc;s smiling! I&#x02bc;ve watched it about 15 times today because I was
trying to edit it, and it melts my heart every time.
