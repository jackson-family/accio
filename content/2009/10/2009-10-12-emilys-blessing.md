We were fortunate to have a metric ton of family come to Austin for
Emily&#x02bc;s blessing. Here we have Rebecca&#x02bc;s parents and grandmother
with Emily, Rebecca and me:

And here we have a very proud grandfather and a very sleepy Emily:

The Allens had to get out of town after church, but all the Jacksons (and
Woodsworths and Starks and Motts) came to our home for lunch. Here&#x02bc;s the
entire crowd:

Unfortunately, Emily fell asleep on the way home from church and stayed asleep
until just about everyone was gone, so she didn&#x02bc;t make it into the
picture.

Thanks to everyone who could come! We enjoyed visiting and hugging everyone.
