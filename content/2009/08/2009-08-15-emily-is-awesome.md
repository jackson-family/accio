The last few days have been an exciting beginning of a grand adventure. Rebecca
and I are operating on little sleep, but we are ably assisted by
Rebecca&#x02bc;s mother Ann and sister Carrie. We don&#x02bc;t know what we will
do when they leave, but I&#x02bc;m sure we will manage.

Emily maintains the monopoly on cute in the house. She even manages to make
ill-fitting clothing evoke all kinds of &ldquo;oooh!&rdquo;s and
&ldquo;aaah!&rdquo;s around here. She is definitely the star of the show at the
moment.

I have changed more diapers this week than in the rest of my life; it may have
been interesting to keep count, but I already gave up after the first day.

Babies in general are wonderful. Mine in particular is a joy and a blessing.
