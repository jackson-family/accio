This is what we have so far. (I have taken much better pictures with my much
better camera, but I don&#x02bc;t have my cable to get the pictures off the
camera, so you are stuck with a cellphone photo.)

Emily Maryann Jackson was born Monday, 10 August, 2009 at 07:59. She weighed 7
pounds, 4 ounces, was 20 inches long, and is the most beautiful baby in the
world, ever.
