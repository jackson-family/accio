This quote from [Elder Holland&#x02bc;s talk][a] has been on my mind for the
last few weeks:

[a]: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2008/10/the-ministry-of-angels

> From the beginning down through the dispensations, God has used angels as His
> emissaries in conveying love and concern for His children &hellip;
>
> Usually such beings are *not* seen. Sometimes they are. But seen or unseen
> they are *always* near. Sometimes their assignments are very grand and have
> significance for the whole world. Sometimes the messages are more private.
> Occasionally the angelic purpose is to warn. But most often it is to comfort,
> to provide some form of merciful attention, guidance in difficult times.

I&#x02bc;ve been thinking about people who have demonstrated something angelic
while William and I are adjusting to life with Emily.

1. The nurses at the hospital where Emily was born were kind, patient, and so
   knowledgeable. In particular, the nurse who attended most of Emily&#x02bc;s
   delivery kept me from having a total meltdown. I especially liked her because
   her last name was Allen, and she told me that her daughter&#x02bc;s name was
   Rebecca. Maybe she was extra nice to me for that reason, but I will be
   forever grateful for her good care.
2. My mom came to stay with us for a few days after Emily was born. She cooked,
   she fussed over Emily, she patted my back when I cried (more times than I
   care to remember), she shopped for us, and she extended her stay a few days
   when I developed a fever and couldn&#x02bc;t leave my bedroom.
3. My sister Carrie also came to visit with my mom, and she was a lifesaver. She
   cooked, she bounced Emily, she kept us laughing with her wisecracks about how
   bad the _Twilight_ movie is, and she let Emily suck on her fingers for hours.
   I&#x02bc;m going to miss her when she goes back to Utah this week!
4. My brother and sister-in-law saved our tails by running a few errands for us
   late at night while we were in the hospital. Thanks to them, we didn&#x02bc;t
   come home to moldy linens that had sat in the washing machine for 4 days.
5. Members of our ward have brought us some tasty meals. Our fridge is well
   stocked and it&#x02bc;s made life so much easier not to have to cook for a
   few days. (I don&#x02bc;t know what I&#x02bc;m going to do when our
   ready-made food runs out &hellip;)
6. William has been my favorite angel. He really has been a lifesaver while
   I&#x02bc;m adjusting to full-time motherhood. He gets up with Emily in the
   night, he changes her messiest diapers, he&#x02bc;s a pro at burping her,
   he&#x02bc;s run most of the errands, he&#x02bc;s done all the laundry for the
   last two weeks, he&#x02bc;s offered priesthood blessings in the middle of
   long painful nights, he still holds my hand and wipes away my tears of joy or
   frustration, and he&#x02bc;s given me countless other reasons to fall more
   and more in love with him each day.

As I reflect on the help that we&#x02bc;ve received, Elder Holland&#x02bc;s
counsel certainly rings true, for we have been comforted in trying times and
received just the merciful attention that we&#x02bc;ve so needed.
