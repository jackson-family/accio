At BYU, I worked for two years as a teaching assistant for Eric Huntsman, who
was one of my all-time favorite professors. I also took his classes in Latin and
Greek and Roman history. He has since moved over to teach at BYU&#x02bc;s
religion department, and it is better for having hired him there. I can say that
confidently because I took his New Testament class during my last semester of
graduate school, and it was easily my favorite class. Seeing an [article][a] of
his in the April _Ensign_ reminded me of something.

A few years ago, he emailed me a set of scripture readings that were appropriate
for Easter. It&#x02bc;s readings from the four gospels and the Book of Mormon
about the events of the Holy Week. Each day of Holy Week has verses describing
the events of that day. I thought I&#x02bc;d share it here for anyone
who&#x02bc;s interested. It has certainly helped me focus more on the
significance and sacredness of the last week of our Savior&#x02bc;s life. (I
have to warn you, though. The readings for Thursday and the Last Supper are a
doozy. Start reading early.)
