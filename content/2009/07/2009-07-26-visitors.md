Look who came all the way from Lubbock to see us: Lorraine, Ellen, Jack, Rose,
and Mary. They came down on Saturday for lunch and a good visit. The kids spent
most of the time running outside to the playscape, swinging for a few minutes,
and then running inside for a drink or snack. Clearly they were unaware of just
how hot it is outside. I got to hear Mary&#x02bc;s engagement story, complete
with Taco Bell details, and admire her ring. It was so fun to see them! I hope
that we get to see Lorraine &amp; Co. more than once a year, though.

This picture reminds me of that _Sesame Street_ song, &ldquo;Which of These
Things is Not Like the Other?&rdquo; (Obviously, I&#x02bc;m the only non-Jackson
in the picture. Crazy how much they all look alike, huh?)

Lorraine was a good sport about going out in 100+ degree weather to push her
kids on the swing. She might have to come and push my kids, too, because
I&#x02bc;m a wimp when it comes to the heat.

And here I am with baby Rose. (I thought about putting this picture on Facebook
to see if anyone thought that she was my kid.) Thanks for a fun visit, everyone!
