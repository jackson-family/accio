My two friends gave me (Emily, actually) five headbands to coordinate with her
many outfits. Up until now, I&#x02bc;ve just taken her out bare-headed and hoped
that she would be recognized as a girl by virtue of wearing a pink outfit, like
the one she&#x02bc;s wearing here.<sup>\*</sup> See, pink pants=girl. Easy,
right?

But look at these cute headbands. The possibilities are endless!

<sup>\*</sup> Except for those days when it gets unexpectedly cold and she has
to wear her pajamas because I don&#x02bc;t have any tiny winter clothes for her.
These particular PJ&#x02bc;s belonged to my nephews but my sister-in-law gave
them to me because she thought it made her boys look like girls. And I think it
makes Emily look like a boy. So.
