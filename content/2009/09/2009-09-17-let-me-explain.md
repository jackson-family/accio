The previous post is just to show a video of Emily being cute, but we
didn&#x02bc;t explain that well. She&#x02bc;s not doing anything especially
exciting because she is 5 weeks old yet and hasn&#x02bc;t even learned how to
smile, much less laugh or hold her head up or say &ldquo;Mama.&rdquo; If
you&#x02bc;re still curious to see the video, you can follow this [link][a] and
push play.

And just so you don&#x02bc;t feel totally cheated, here&#x02bc;s a cute picture
of Emily.
