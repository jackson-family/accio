Rebecca handed me her cup of lemonade. She was offering me a drink. I drank and
left maybe a quarter of a mouthful in the bottom. She looked at it and frowned.
Clearly I drank too much.

I said, &ldquo;Whenever we share something, one of us always ends up sad.&rdquo;

Rebecca replied, &ldquo;Better you than me.&rdquo;

I laughed uncontrollably.

(Also: as I was writing this post, Rebecca said, &ldquo;You need to explain that
better or it&#x02bc;s going to make me look bad.&rdquo;)
