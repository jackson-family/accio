(Warning: angry rant about my job ahead. I mostly needed to vent, so it
won&#x02bc;t hurt my feelings if you don&#x02bc;t read this.)

Last week, I got the following email from our parking coordinator at work.

<blockquote class="blockquote pl-3 border-left">
    <p>Rebecca - effective <strong>Monday, 01/12/09</strong>, space 1042 will be
    your assigned parking space, and your assignment at the Capitol
    Visitor&#x02bc;s (CV) garage will terminate. Please remove the CV garage
    decal from your vehicle(s).</p>
    <p>The CV access card #10290 issued to you in May of 2006, must be returned
    to Parking Administration in Rm. 153, before close of business on Tuesday,
    01/13/09.</p>
    <p>You will receive a separate email regarding decal placement.</p>
</blockquote>

Right now, I park across the street in a parking garage. I don&#x02bc;t mind
parking there because the parking is covered, and every little bit of exercise
helps. Parking in the onsite garage is limited, so parking is assigned based on
years of state service. I have about 3.5 years of service, and I know there are
other people with more service than I have who are still parking in the same
parking garage as me. So, I emailed her back:

<blockquote class="blockquote pl-3 border-left">
    <p>Is this an uncovered parking space? If possible, I&#x02bc;d prefer to
    stay in the CV with covered parking and let someone else from the CV lot
    move to the spot that you&#x02bc;ve recommended from me. Is that a problem?
    (Just thought I&#x02bc;d ask before committing &hellip;)</p>
</blockquote>

This is her response:

<blockquote class="blockquote pl-3 border-left">
    <p>Unfortunately, Rebecca, that is no longer an option. If you qualify based
    on longevity and there is a parking space available, you are required to
    move to TWC property. Sorry</p>
</blockquote>

That was *it*. She signed it with &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo;? I&#x02bc;m pretty sure
that she was not sorry at all, but rather, was sitting in her little office in
the basement of our other building rubbing her hands together and smirking at
the supreme power that she wields over my agency.

At that point, I was getting a little worked up about the whole thing because it
seemed like such a ridiculous policy. I asked our admin to call Parking and talk
to them again. Turns out that if I choose not to take the spot that
they&#x02bc;ve assigned me, I forgo my current spot as well as any future
chances at a covered parking spot. I would have to be assigned to any spot in
the onsite lot that was available due to employee illness or travel or whatever
caused that spot to be free that day. And if there were no spots free from my
department, Parking would be unable to find me a spot because I had made the
conscious decision not to accept an assigned spot. Yes, that&#x02bc;s right:
Parking would *refuse* to help me find a spot. Isn&#x02bc;t that their job? If
they&#x02bc;re sitting around refusing to help people find parking spaces, what
are they doing all day, sleeping? Playing _World of Warcraft_ on state-owned
computers? Selling state property on eBay?

So, tomorrow, I&#x02bc;ll be parking in the onsite garage for the first time, in
an uncovered parking spot that I didn&#x02bc;t ask for. And on Tuesday, I have
to meet with a security guard to remove my old parking sticker and apply the new
one and sign several documents confirming this exchange. I&#x02bc;m surprised
that I&#x02bc;m not being asked to hire a notary for the event. I only hope that
it&#x02bc;s raining because then the guard will have to change my tag in the
rain, instead of in the covered spot that I had requested. Such an irony.

Working for the state really isn&#x02bc;t worth it sometimes.
