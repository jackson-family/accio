If you can somehow manage, as I did, to contract strep throat just before
Thanksgiving, the thought of eating anything will make you cringe with pain and
keep you away from all of those otherwise tempting Thanksgiving dishes.

This is how my week was supposed to go.

**Monday**: William goes to work, and Emily and I hang out all day and have a
marvelous time.

**Tuesday**: William goes to work, and Emily and I hang out all day and have a
marvelous time.

**Wednesday**: William has the most boring day of work ever, and I stay home
with Emily and start making things for Thanksgiving dinner.

**Thursday**: Thanksgiving dinner at our house with all of my family members
there to join the fun. My parents take Emily home with them.

**Friday**: William and I go to Dallas for Mary and Luke&#x02bc;s wedding and
stay there for two more days at a posh hotel.

**Saturday**: William and I explore Dallas all day and have a fancy dinner out.

**Sunday**: We drive back to Austin, along with all of creation, and get Emily
back.

This is how it actually went.

**Monday**: William went to work, and I started feeling sick in the afternoon.
Luckily Emily was really low-key that day, so I didn&#x02bc;t have to do a lot
to keep her happy.

**Tuesday**: I woke up with a killer sore throat and a raging fever and
didn&#x02bc;t get out of bed all day. William took a sick day from work and
watched Emily all day.

**Wednesday**: After a sleepless night, I woke up still feeling terrible.
William took another sick day to watch Emily. I went to the doctor and got a
prescription for a mega antibiotic to treat strep throat. I figured that if I
*did* have strep throat, I really didn&#x02bc;t want to have to wait through a
holiday weekend to get it treated.

**Thursday**: We cancelled Thanksgiving at our house. We cancelled our hotel
reservation in Dallas. Mom and Dad came and took Emily anyway. I cried when she
left.

**Friday**: William left at 7:30 for Dallas. I spent the entire day home alone
in bed except for when I did manage to roast my turkey. Pretty much everything
made me cry. No William, no Emily, no weekend in Dallas, no voice (yeah, my
voice was gone by then), no Thanksgiving, no appetite even though I was starving
all day. Oh, and our garage door broke, so I was trapped in the house.

**Saturday**: I felt well enough to get out of bed and start cooking
Thanksgiving-like food. We had a family Thanksgiving meal here. And we got Emily
back, and I was able to hold her and kiss her for the first time in five days.

**Sunday**: At least we&#x02bc;re not stuck in the parking lot called I-35
driving back from Dallas &hellip;
