I&#x02bc;ve been reading a lot more books now that I&#x02bc;m home all day with
Emily. Some are good, and a handful are not.

1. _The Sweet Life in Paris_ by David Lebovitz. Funny stories about an American
   adapting to life in Paris and a smattering of tasty recipes, too.
2. _The Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet_ by Jamie Ford. A bittersweet
   book about the American internment of Japanese citizens during World War II.
   I just found this one on a shelf in the library, and it turned out to be
   really good.
3. _The Alchemyst_ by Michael Scott. This entire series has completely captured
   my imagination. I just can&#x02bc;t get over how cleverly he works myths and
   historical figures from all cultures into this series. (Thanks for the heads
   up, Lorraine.) The writing is really good, too, so adults won&#x02bc;t get
   bored reading a kids book.

And the TV show that I&#x02bc;m recently obsessed with is BBC&#x02bc;s _Robin
Hood_. My friend Melissa tipped me off about this one, so we got it from the
library and are hooked. It&#x02bc;s so exciting! The bad guys are really, really
rotten, and the good guys always beat them in the end, in the most clever ways.
I think Robin is foxy, and William thinks Marian is foxy. Everyone wins. I
can&#x02bc;t wait for Season 3 to come out on DVD.

And I&#x02bc;m always looking for something new to read. (Except if you suggest
_Twilight_ to me as a &ldquo;good read,&rdquo; I might judge you.)
