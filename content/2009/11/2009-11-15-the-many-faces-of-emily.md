Emily was 3 months old last Tuesday. I can&#x02bc;t believe how fast the time
has gone by, but I&#x02bc;m enjoying my cute baby girl. Her smile and laugh are
coming out in full force and she&#x02bc;s starting to get better at rolling
over. She usually spends her mornings practicing rolling over or grabbing her
toys. And she is usually so calm and happy. Even last night at stake conference
when she was beyond tired and hungry (and I totally forgot the diaper bag at
home), she was just squirming around instead of screaming at us.

One of the things I love most about her is her expressive face. She has so many
sweet and funny faces that she makes. I finally got smart and decided to keep
the camera close by, instead of tucked away neatly in a drawer. These are some
pictures that I&#x02bc;ve taken over the last few days when we&#x02bc;ve been
dinking around at home or on a walk.
