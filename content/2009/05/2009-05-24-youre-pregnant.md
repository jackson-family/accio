I think most of you know that I am expecting a baby girl on August 4 (or
thereabouts). But I am still, yes, still getting people coming up to me at
church or at work to say, &ldquo;Are you pregnant? I had no idea!&rdquo; And
then I tell them that I am at 30 weeks, and they usually look even more
surprised. This makes me smile because that implies that I haven&#x02bc;t gotten
terribly large. And I haven&#x02bc;t had to have a million versions of the
&ldquo;How have you been feeling?&rdquo; conversation.

I don&#x02bc;t want this to turn into a mommy blog, at least just yet, but I
suppose that I should put at least one pregnancy picture here for the record.
What do you think?

I should also note that I really, really like this shirt, which my friend Liz
lent me. I can&#x02bc;t promise that she will get it back &hellip;
