As I promised in an earlier post, here are a few more pictures of the things
that I&#x02bc;ve painted.

My class ended 2 weeks ago, and we had to display our paintings for the class to
see, like a mini-show. Here&#x02bc;s what I put up.

Here are some paintings that I threw together when I was just mixing up
different colors to see how they played together. Quite nicely, I think.

And here is what our kitchen table looks like when I&#x02bc;m trying to work.
It&#x02bc;s fun to make a big mess.

I can&#x02bc;t wait to do more painting in our house, with actual natural light!
