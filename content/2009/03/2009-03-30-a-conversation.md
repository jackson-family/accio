For all of you who don&#x02bc;t live close enough to us for me to talk to you in
person, here&#x02bc;s a conversation that we should have.

You: Hey, Rebecca! I haven&#x02bc;t seen you in so long! How the heck are you?

Me: Oh, I&#x02bc;m doing great, as usual. How are you?

You: Great! So, what&#x02bc;s new?

Me: Well, I&#x02bc;m having a baby in August.

You: AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! THAT&#x02bc;S SO EXCITING! I didn&#x02bc;t know
you were pregnant! You&#x02bc;re not showing at all! Are you so excited?

Me: Yes (*note: how else would you expect me to answer that?*)

You: YAY! Is William so excited?

Me: Yes! Even more so than me!

You: When are you due?

Me: August 4.

You: Oh, you poor thing. I&#x02bc;m so sorry about that. You&#x02bc;re going to
be so, so hot and uncomfortable, especially in this summer heat.

Me: Well, I suppose. Thank you. (*thinking, &ldquo;Isn&#x02bc;t that what air
conditioning and swimming pools are for?&rdquo;*)

You: How have you been feeling?

Me: Totally fine. No problems at all.

You: Are you serious? I/my mom/my sister/my friend was so sick and gained
10/15/30/50 pounds during her first trimester even though she couldn&#x02bc;t
eat anything and then my/her back started aching and didn&#x02bc;t stop until
after the baby was born. And girl, don&#x02bc;t expect all that baby flab to
come off easily!

Me: I guess I&#x02bc;m pretty lucky that way. I take after my mom, fortunately.

You: So, you&#x02bc;re really feeling OK? Not even a teeny bit of morning
sickness?

Me: Nope. Uh, sorry? (*note: by this point, I&#x02bc;m starting to wish that I
had something more interesting to say. Turns out pregnancy is kind of boring.*)

You: So, when do you find out what you&#x02bc;re having? Or do you know already?
Let me take a look at your stomach and predict what you&#x02bc;re having. A boy?

Me: No, we found out on Wednesday that we&#x02bc;re actually having a girl.

You: Aw, that&#x02bc;s so great! Girls are so much easier than boys! Can I buy
you something pink?

Me: I guess. But I still like boys. My nephews are all great fun. Hmm, no pink
just yet. We&#x02bc;re moving into a house soon, so I&#x02bc;m trying not to buy
a bunch of stuff that we&#x02bc;ll have to move.

You: (*ignoring the exciting part about how we&#x02bc;re buying a house at the
end of April*) But little girls look so cute in pink. I&#x02bc;ll find you
something pink, don&#x02bc;t worry.

Me: Thank you! Can&#x02bc;t wait to see it.

You: And you&#x02bc;re feeling OK? All the morning sickness has passed?

Me: Still feeling OK. Haven&#x02bc;t had morning sickness, weird cravings, food
aversions, aches and pains, violent mood swings (though William may disagree
with that), etc. It&#x02bc;s all good.

You: You&#x02bc;re so lucky. So, do you have any pictures of her?

Me: Yes, look here:

You: Wow, that 3-D picture is amazing! I didn&#x02bc;t know they could do that
these days. Ooh, that other picture of her face is kind of freaky.

Me: I know. Ultrasounds aren&#x02bc;t terribly precise, I guess.

You: So, have you picked out any names?

Me: Not really, though my friend lent me two books about baby names. Who needs
50,000 baby names, when you can have one?

You: Ha ha! (*note: it&#x02bc;s about time you laughed at one of my jokes*)

Me: Here are my rules for baby names. 1. You must be able to tell that
it&#x02bc;s a girl from her name. 2. You must be able to pronounce her name when
you see it written out. 3. It cannot be deliberately misspelled. For example, no
changing a Y at the end to an I just to be cute.

You: Yeah, I hate weird names, too. Well, I&#x02bc;m so excited for you! Keep me
posted!

Me: Will do. Talk to you later. Thanks for letting me share my happy news!
