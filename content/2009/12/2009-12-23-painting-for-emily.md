Emily&#x02bc;s bedroom is pretty boring. The walls are plain white, her crib has
a brown bumper and pink sheets that don&#x02bc;t match anything, and she
doesn&#x02bc;t have any cute bookshelves or toy baskets. I just wasn&#x02bc;t
feeling inspired to decorate when I was pregnant with her, I guess.

But now I&#x02bc;ve realized that she doesn&#x02bc;t have anything that
I&#x02bc;ve made for her. No quilts or blankets, no knitted cap or booties, no
hand-painted letters spelling out &ldquo;Emily,&rdquo; no cross-stitch panels to
commemorate her full name and date of birth. Nothing. And of course, there are
plenty of moms around me that do things like this, and so I felt a little guilty
not being so excited about my daughter&#x02bc;s birth that I made her a quilt.
(In my defense, I would&#x02bc;ve had to (a) buy a sewing machine, (b) learn how
to use it, and (c) come up with a cute quilt pattern and equally cute fabric.
While pregnant. And working full-time. And buying a new house and moving into
it. Eh.)

I started taking watercolor lessons from my friend [Abbey][a] a few months ago.
She comes over twice a month and we paint together. She gives me good ideas for
projects, including this one. Do a wash with several colors and let it dry.
Sketch a shape onto the paper. Thin some white acrylic paint and go over
everything except the outlined shape. I had so much fun doing this one that I
thought I could make it work as paintings for Emily&#x02bc;s room. The shapes I
chose were sun, moon, and stars, so maybe this is her first astronomy lesson.

I also wanted to have a way for Emily to keep the paintings later in case she
didn&#x02bc;t want to hang them on her wall forever. I didn&#x02bc;t want to
invest in fancy frames for display because that would be too bulky. I thought
that ribbon would be cute and way less expensive. So, I punched holes in the
corners of the paintings and looped ribbon through to make a simple hanging
loop. Here&#x02bc;s what I ended up with.

(The cord hanging down the wall is from the baby monitor.)

Maybe there&#x02bc;s hope for her room yet. Next up, deciding what color to
paint it.
