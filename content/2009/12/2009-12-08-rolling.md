Emily rolled over on Saturday night for the first time.* I&#x02bc;m not sure
that she knows how she did it, because for the last three days she&#x02bc;s
tried to flip herself over, with no success, and gotten mad. But I took pictures
of Saturday night&#x02bc;s Roll Over.

\* William says that she didn&#x02bc;t really roll over because her left arm is
still kind of tucked under her. But I say that she rolled over because she ended
up on her stomach, and I didn&#x02bc;t put her there. What do you think?
