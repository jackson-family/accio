I did recover pretty well from my illness, and we had a belated family
Thanksgiving dinner. Mom and Dad wanted pictures of their grandchildren for the
Christmas letter, so we busted out the camera and took pictures with
increasingly hilarious results. And for the record, I would like to point out
that my child is *not* the one cutting up in the pictures. (Ahem,
Markandmonica.)
