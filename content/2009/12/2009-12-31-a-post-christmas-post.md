I hope that everyone had as good a Christmas as we had. We spent Christmas Day
with the Allens in New Braunfels and then headed to Waco for a belated
celebration with the Jacksons. We also hosted my dad&#x02bc;s extended family
for a celebration here. Lots of driving and packing and unpacking and
re-packing, but we&#x02bc;re glad we were able to see everyone so easily.

I was trying to decide which pictures to post when I realized that most of the
pictures are of Emily. I got one picture of the three of us, and that&#x02bc;s
probably because Carrie said, &ldquo;I want to take your picture!&rdquo; So,
anyway. Here are some of the cutest pictures from Christmas.

William propped her up here, and she stayed standing. She seems to prefer
standing up to sitting or rolling over. Also, her onesie says,
&ldquo;Baby&#x02bc;s First Christmas&rdquo; and has pictures of reindeer on it.
As you&#x02bc;ll see from the pictures below, it didn&#x02bc;t make it through
the day. And her pants were too big so they kept falling down.

Pretty much the only picture of me with Emily because either I was taking the
picture or William was playing with her.

Aunt Carrie and Emily had a great time getting decked out.

Emily did a pretty good job of opening her presents, except she kept eating the
tissue paper.

And here we have one tired little girl who pulled out a lot of that teddy
bear&#x02bc;s fur.
