Emily is four months old today! She celebrated it by sleeping until 8 and having
a warm bottle when she woke up. It&#x02bc;s going to be a good day for her.

She&#x02bc;s started doing a few new interesting things.

* Her smile is much more regular now, and she beams when she sees me and William
  (and random strangers, too.)

* She&#x02bc;s still working on rolling over.
* She clumsily turns the pages of books. Her favorite book is _Brown Bear, Brown
  Bear, What Do You See?_
* She loves to be on her stomach and can hold her head up really high.

* Just this week, she&#x02bc;s started grabbing things and working on holding
  her toys.
* She likes to pull her blanket over her face and then pull it off again. (Is
  that safe? I don&#x02bc;t know, but it&#x02bc;s really cute to watch her play
  peekaboo with herself.)
* She&#x02bc;s had some great belly laughs when I dress her in the morning.
  Something about being naked is really funny to her.

* And finally, she&#x02bc;s started screeching. Sigh.
