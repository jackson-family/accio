Emily was four weeks old yesterday and doesn'&#x02bc;t seem any worse for the
wear. In fact, I think she&#x02bc;s getting cuter now that she&#x02bc;s starting
to gain weight properly.

Yesterday, our ward had a Labor Day picnic at a park nearby. I was worried that
Emily would get sunburned, so I bought her a hat at the Gap outlet. As luck
would have it, she ended up not needing the hat just yet, which should give her
a little time to grow into it.

(Also, please note that this hat is not pink, which means that it clashes with
almost everything else that she owns.)

And my dad always says that babies look like [Winston Churchill][a]. You be the
judge.

My favorite part about Emily is that her smile is about to burst out.
Here&#x02bc;s just the slightest hint of a crooked smile. That&#x02bc;s how we
know she&#x02bc;s mine!
