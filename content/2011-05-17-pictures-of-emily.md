When Emily finds me on my computer at home, her typical request is to see
pictures of Emily. I have a photo album that I keep on standby for just such a
request. Recently, Emily has taken to describing each picture. I was describing
this behavior to friends and I thought it would be funny to share what Emily
thinks of these pictures.

You can let me know if you think it is funny.
