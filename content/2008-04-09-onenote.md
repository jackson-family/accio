For those of you who have asked what OneNote is, I&#x02bc;ll link here to
Natalie&#x02bc;s blog where she extols the virtues of using it for recipe
organization: [http://perrysplate.blogspot.com/2008/03/recipe.html][a].
(Apparently, I&#x02bc;m not the only one who doesn&#x02bc;t like having a folder
full of recipes torn out from magazines and newspapers!)
