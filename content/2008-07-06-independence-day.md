Friday morning Rebecca and I ate pancakes and bacon and applesauce at the church
with the rest of our ward. We sang patriotic songs together, including
[*Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean*][a]. While I do not recall hearing these
lyrics before, I knew I recognized the tune. I found it in the hymnal, as *Up,
Awake, Ye Defenders of Zion* (248).

For lunch we met with all the local Allens at The Salt Lick: Rebecca&#x02bc;s
parents, Grandma, Grandmother (and believe me, there is a difference), and
brother Mark and his family. The Salt Lick makes delicious barbecue; I
especially like the sausage.

Next Rebecca and I drove to Waco to spend the balance of the weekend with my
family. We had some delicious barbecue chicken for dinner, played dominoes and
watched *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*. On Saturday, we took my
brother Mark shopping and picked up new shoes for me, Rebecca and Mark, as well
as a new hard disk drive for my dad. We lounged about in the afternoon, watched
*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, and had dinner with my parents&#x02bc;
ward at the Waco chapel: hamburgers and hot dogs. Very good.
