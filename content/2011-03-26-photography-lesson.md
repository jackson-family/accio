Among other things, Rebecca gave me a pass to go on a photography field trip for
my birthday. I signed up for this morning&#x02bc;s session. Nine students and
one instructor met at a coffee shop in east Austin with our point-and-shoot
cameras, ready to learn.

To begin, Joel, our instructor, introduced us to several features on our cameras
and explained how to use them: ISO, exposure compensation, metering, white
balance, &amp;c. Then he gave us some tips on composing photos: the rule of
thirds, creative points-of-view, and perspective lines.

After the instruction, we started walking around and practicing what we learned.
Joel was very helpful when I needed clarification or additional help.

I had a lot of fun! I learned a lot and I feel like I have a better idea of how
to take much better pictures. These are just a few of the photos I shot today.

I think this next one will make a good desktop background.

The last one is an old telephone pole with no wires that has been taken over by
the local plant life.
