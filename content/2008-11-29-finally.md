So, we&#x02bc;re going to start posting blogs about our trip. I think
it&#x02bc;d probably be kindest to do it in bits, like one or two posts a day,
so that you don&#x02bc;t have to read about 2 weeks worth of amazingness all at
once. I&#x02bc;ve got to leave you with a reason to come back, right? The posts
will be in chronological order, even though Blogger will insist on posting the
newest post first. If you&#x02bc;re feeling really dedicated, be sure to check
for earlier posts to make sure you haven&#x02bc;t missed anything. Enjoy!
