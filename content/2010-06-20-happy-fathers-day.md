Today is my first Father&#x02bc;s Day as a father. Emily recently discovered and
fell in love with our slide. Well, I told her it was *her* slide, because
she&#x02bc;s the only kid we have. Emily runs this place, did you know?

Also, Emily has not yet slid down the slide. She prefers to use it as more of a
*seat*. But it makes her happy, so I won&#x02bc;t rush her into sliding anytime
soon. She will continue to thoroughly enjoy *sitting* on her *seat*.

Today for Father&#x02bc;s Day, Rebecca gave me a windshield visor and steering
wheel cover for my car. The weather gets hot in the summer, you see, when you
live in Texas, and I don&#x02bc;t always have the opportunity to park my car in
the shade. I have a hard time driving home from work when my steering wheel is
hot enough to cook ground beef on, according to the windshield visor packaging.
I could also cook a turkey on the dashboard.

Who needs a grill?
