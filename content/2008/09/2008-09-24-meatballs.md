This recipe is based on the recipe for [Baked Meatballs][a] on
[The Crepes of Wrath][b], one of Rebecca&#x02bc;s favorite food blogs.

I made them Tuesday night while Rebecca wrote that awesome entry about our
weekend in New Braunfels. We had them on spaghetti.

### Baked Meatballs

*   1 pound ground beef
*   1 pound ground pork
*   &half; cup Parmesan
*   1 egg
*   1 Tablespoon dried Italian seasoning
*   1 teaspoon garlic powder
*   1 teaspoon kosher salt
*   &half; teaspoon red pepper flakes
*   &half; cup bread crumbs (with Italian seasoning if you want)
*   Parmesan, for sprinkling

1.  Preheat the oven to 400 &deg;F. In a big bowl, combine the ground beef,
    ground pork, &half; cup Parmesan, egg, Italian seasoning, garlic powder,
    salt, red pepper flakes, and &frac14; cup bread crumbs. Mix all of the
    ingredients together with your hands until everything is evenly distributed.
    Don&#x02bc;t mash it up too much though, you don&#x02bc;t want it to turn
    into a paste!
2.  Place the leftover &frac14; cup of bread crumbs into a smaller bowl. Using
    your hands, roll the meatballs into balls (I usually do them about a little
    smaller than a golfball), roll the meatballs in the bread crumbs and place
    the meatballs on a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil. Sprinkle with a
    bit of extra Parmesan cheese. Bake for 25 minutes or until the cheese is
    bubbly and the meatballs look golden brown.

These meatballs are better than the ones we usually buy at IKEA. There, I said
it! Better than IKEA!
