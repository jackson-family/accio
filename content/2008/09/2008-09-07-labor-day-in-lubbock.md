At last, I&#x02bc;m sitting down to post my account of our trip to Lubbock for
Labor Day. We got to see Lorraine and Jack, David and Chelsea, Ben and Kaylyn,
and Jared and Meredith. Clearly we got our money&#x02bc;s worth out of the trip!

We didn&#x02bc;t really do much, but I still have pictures. Maybe I&#x02bc;ll
just let the pictures do most of the talking.

About a month ago, I took a business trip through west Texas, and one of the
groups that we met with told us to look out for the turbans along the road. And
I thought that was a rather strange thing to look for, as if there were small
clans of North Africans huddled along the state highways of west Texas clad in
turbans. So, we were driving and I thought to ask my co-workers, &ldquo;What did
they mean by &lsquo;turbans&rsquo;?&rdquo; and they pointed out the window and I
saw *turbines* similar to these. I felt pretty dumb, but honestly, who says
&ldquo;turban&rdquo; when they mean &ldquo;turbine&rdquo;? Sheesh. But then on
the way to Lubbock we saw more of them.

Here are Ellen and Jack with Winnie the Pooh and Eeyore. Ellen wanted me to take
her picture a whole lot, so I told her to go get ready. And she pulled out the
stuffed animals and carefully set them up. And then she positioned Jack and
herself in between them for the picture. I guess in her 3-year old mind, no
picture is complete without her favorite stuffed animals. (See below &mdash;
this was taken the next day.)

We went to see the Lubbock Temple on Sunday afternoon. I was pleased to see that
the spire had the Lone Star well represented.

Lorraine set out a 1000-piece puzzle that Jack&#x02bc;s mom had given Ellen (who
gives a puzzle like that to a 3-year old??) and everyone worked on it Sunday
night. And by Monday morning, it was finished.

On Monday, the kids were getting antsy so they brought out their Legos to play
with. But they weren&#x02bc;t nearly as interested in the Legos as Dave and
Chelsea were.

I think this picture is funny mostly because Bentley is showing off all of his
teeth, like a lion.

Here we are with Ben (William&#x02bc;s cousin) and Kaylyn, holding kids that
don&#x02bc;t actually belong to any of us in the picture. Like I said, Ellen
really liked having her picture taken.

And here&#x02bc;s one with almost everyone, except Lorraine (who was taking
pictures) and Jack (who was taking a nap).

And this is my new favorite picture of us. We saw this sign somewhere between
Lubbock and Austin. Sweet, huh?
