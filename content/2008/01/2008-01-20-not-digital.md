Our nephew John (the son of the brother of Rebecca) is three years old and loves
to ask questions. He also understands fairly well how most technology is
supposed to work. The first time he came to visit our apartment, he had me take
him around and show him everything. After a while, he asked,
&ldquo;Where&#x02bc;s the television?&rdquo; I thought that was funny. I
don&#x02bc;t think he had ever been to a house without a television before.

He was also here yesterday for Rebecca&#x02bc;s birthday. His grandmother (my
mother-in-law Ann) took a picture of him with a one-time-use camera, and he
immediately jumped over to her and said, &ldquo;I want to see the
picture.&rdquo; Ann then had to explain to him the difference between a digital
camera and a film camera.
