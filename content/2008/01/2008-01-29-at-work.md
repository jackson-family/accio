I&#x02bc;m on an email distribution list where people may submit questions to
TWC&#x02bc;s Policy department for response.

Here&#x02bc;s the entire email text of the question we were to answer:

`If a parent obtains the OAG information via internet using their CIN, do we
still need to have the 1825 signed?`

One of the other managers on the distribution list did a Reply-to-All email with
this comment:

`Hopefully someone knows what in the world this person is talking about.`

I wish we could answer more questions that way.
