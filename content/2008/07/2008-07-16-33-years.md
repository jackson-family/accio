Today is Mom and Dad&#x02bc;s 33<sup>rd</sup> wedding anniversary. They are my
favorite couple, and here are some reasons why.

1.  Mom met Dad when she got lost and picked him up off the street so that he
    could help her find her destination. (My aunt was trying to set them up
    because they were both tall and had invited them over to her house for
    dinner.) This is the kind of thing that she always advised my sister and me
    *never* to do. Go, Mom!
2.  Unknown to either of them, Dad&#x02bc;s grandparents bought the house that
    Mom grew up in in Louisiana.
3.  They hold hands in public. And when we tease them about it, they just smile.
4.  In his last stake conference talk, Dad called Mom &ldquo;the love of my
    life.&rdquo; He actually said that to an arena full of people! Go, Dad!
5.  They take good care of each other. Mom irons Dad&#x02bc;s shirts and rubs
    his head when he has a headache. Dad makes Mom laugh.
6.  Their trip to the Washington, D.C. temple for their sealing is a thrilling
    tale, with twists and turns and nail-biting moments, and it&#x02bc;s all the
    sweeter because in the end, they made it.
7.  They&#x02bc;ve been married for 33 years, and they have quite a lot of
    happiness to show for those years.

And here&#x02bc;s a totally sweet picture of them. (I dig Mom&#x02bc;s polka dot
dress and Dad&#x02bc;s extra wide tie.)
