Here is the recipe we followed to make our Honey-Oatmeal Bread. This is from
*The Ultimate Southern Living Cookbook*.

*   Prep: 32 Minutes
*   Rise: 1 hour and 40 minutes
*   Cook: 45 minutes

Ingredients:

*   2&frac14; cups milk
*   &half; cup honey
*   1 cup shortening
*   2&half; teaspoons salt
*   2 packages active dry yeast
*   &half; cup warm water (105 to 115 &deg;F)
*   2 cups regular oats, uncooked
*   6 to 6&half; cups all-purpose flour
*   Butter or margarine, melted

Combine first 4 ingredients in a saucepan; heat until shortening melts. Remove
from heat, and cool to 105 to 115 &deg;F. Combine yeast and warm water in a
1-cup liquid measuring cup; let stand 5 minutes. Combine yeast mixture, liquid
mixture, oats, and 2 cups flour in a large mixing bowl; mix well. Stir in enough
remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn dough out onto a floured surface, and
knead until smooth and elastic (8 to 10 minutes). Place in a greased bowl,
turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 &deg;F), free from
drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

(You can do a lot of things when you are waiting an hour for dough to rise. At
this point we went to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond to buy a second loaf pan, because we
only had one to begin with. We also bought a shoe rack for me to put in the
closet and organize my shoes. Since we got married, Rebecca has had a quest to
make sure I had the right shoes for every occasion, so now I own more shoes than
I ever have. A shoe rack became a necessity.)

Punch dough down; cover and let stand 10 minutes. Divide dough in half; place on
a floured surface. Roll each half to a 15- &times; 9-inch rectangle. Roll up,
jellyroll fashion, starting at narrow end; pinch seams and ends to seal. Place
loaves, seam side down, in two greased 9- &times; 5-inch loaf pans. Brush with
butter.

Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, 40 minutes or until
doubled in bulk. Bake at 375 &deg;F for 45 minutes or until loaves sound hollow
when tapped. Cover with foil the last 15 minutes of baking to prevent excessive
browning. Remove loaves from pans; cool on wire racks. Yield: 2 loaves.
