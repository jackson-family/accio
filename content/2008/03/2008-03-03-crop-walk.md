Saturday, March 1, was the CROP Walk. We had a great turnout from the ward, the
weather was perfect, and the Shoal Creek Ward raised over $2400 for the cause.
Our job for the walk was to count people who started the walk and finished the
walk and to give them a pamphlet that pretty much said, &ldquo;Yay, you finished
the CROP Walk! Now go to our website and donate even more money.&rdquo; I liked
doing that because we got to see people walking. They had different activities
for the kids, including some kind of scavenger hunt. One of the tasks was to
find a man wearing a yellow shirt &mdash; consequently, William signed a lot of
autographs that day for giggling girls. And after everyone else had walked, we
walked the 1.25 mile trail ourselves. I&#x02bc;m glad we got to do it, but
I&#x02bc;m also glad that it&#x02bc;s over!

Here are some pictures from the day.
