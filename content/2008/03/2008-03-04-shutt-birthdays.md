March really is a good month for birthdays, and it&#x02bc;s not even a week old
yet. Here&#x02bc;s a close approximation of the birthday cake that I
would&#x02bc;ve made for Heather and Allen if they had come to my house for
their birthday party. (Except I would&#x02bc;ve changed the name on the cake,
see.)

Anyway, happy birthday to you both! We love you, and come visit us in Austin
some day.
