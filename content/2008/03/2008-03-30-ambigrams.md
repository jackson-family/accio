Having recently finished reading *Angels & Demons* by Dan Brown, I am officially
intrigued by by ambigrams. What is an ambigram, you ask? The best way to explain
it is with an illustration.

Here we have a photograph of me holding up a DVD of *The Princess Bride* which
Rebecca gave me for my birthday. It clearly reads, &ldquo;The Princess
Bride&rdquo;.

Here is the same photograph, rotated 180 degrees:

Amazing.
