One of my favorite parts of the day is breakfast. Usually, every weekday
morning, after Rebecca and I have gotten dressed for work, we pray together then
sit down to a bowl of cereal and a glass of orange juice. Recently we have been
chewing our way through a big box of Honey Nut Cheerios we bought at Costco.

This is also the time we read scriptures together. We take turns reading five
verses each. So we each alternate between a few minutes of reading and a few
minutes of chewing.

Breakfast is one of my favorite parts of the day because: (a) I like to eat; (b)
I like to read scriptures; and (c) I like to be with Rebecca. I always have
wonderful days because I am in the habit of starting them in a wonderful way.
