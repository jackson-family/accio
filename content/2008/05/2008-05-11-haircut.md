I did something new yesterday. For the first time in my life, I cut someone
else&#x02bc;s hair. I mean, I&#x02bc;ve helped out with the occasional
&ldquo;the stylist at the salon missed this bit in the back, so can you please
even it out for me&rdquo; cut for a roommate or friend, but never a full-on
&ldquo;you&#x02bc;re going to look completely different when I&#x02bc;m done
with you&rdquo; cut.

But yesterday, William let me cut his hair. His last few haircuts have been from
this slightly shady barbershop near UT campus, and they were $15 each. But after
listening to William describe his haircuts (&ldquo;Well, you take the number 4
attachment and mow my hair.&rdquo;), I thought that maybe we&#x02bc;d both be
better off all around if I just cut William&#x02bc;s hair. So, I bought a set of
clippers last month, and this week, William&#x02bc;s hair was finally shaggy
enough for us to give it a go.

I was pretty nervous because a haircut gone badly just can&#x02bc;t be
disguised. But William was very patient and showed me how to maneuver the
clippers without buzzing him. At the end of the cut, he said, &ldquo;This is the
shortest my hair has ever been,&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;What do you
mean?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;I left the number 3 attachment on the
clippers.&rdquo; And I screamed. Why didn&#x02bc;t he tell me that I was cutting
it so short? Oh, well. I&#x02bc;m just glad he doesn&#x02bc;t have curly hair or
some weird cowlick.

What do you think? Here&#x02bc;s what he looked like last week.

And here&#x02bc;s what he looks like now.

Well, I guess those pictures don&#x02bc;t really look all that different. Hmm.
But at least he looks happy about the haircut, right?
