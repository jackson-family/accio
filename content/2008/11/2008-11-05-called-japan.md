My monthly Toyota bill still has my maiden name on it. That name served me so
well for so long, so I admittedly have a bit of a hard time changing it still.
But it must be done, especially in important situations that could involve the
payoff of a loan, an accurate credit report, and the correct ownership of a
vehicle title.

So, I called the Toyota customer service line and eventually found myself
talking to &ldquo;Michelle.&rdquo; Except I would be willing to bet you all the
yen in my pocket that her real name was something like Yuko. The connection was
so bad that I could only hear about every other word she said. That, coupled
with her accent, made it a difficult call. I even asked if she could call me
back, and she said, &ldquo;NO, YOU HAVE TO CALL US BACK.&rdquo; Except it was in
more of a bright chirpy voice, rather than the roar suggested by my use of all
caps. So, we muddled through. After confirming all kinds of information about
myself, I told her to change my last name to Jackson. I just hope that she heard
me correctly. And she read back what I had told her, and I think she pronounced
Austin &ldquo;Ow-stin.&rdquo; And then she said, in the same bright chirpy
voice, &ldquo;THANKYOUFORCALLINGTOYOTAHAVEANICEDAY.&rdquo; *click* I hope she
got it right &hellip;

I always thought my first call to Japan would have been more exciting.
