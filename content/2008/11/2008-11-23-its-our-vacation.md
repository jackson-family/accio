Internet is ridiculously expensive on this ship, so this will be a short blog
post to let all of our faithful and curious readers know that we&#x02bc;re doing
well and enjoying almost every minute of our trip. We&#x02bc;ve met so many
interesting people, have eaten more than we should, and have seen so many
beautiful places. The people-watching on our ship is amazing, since there are
plenty of Germans and other Europeans for entertainment. I hope they find us
quite as interesting as we do them.

The weather has largely cooperated, except in Italy. We hit a really bad storm
on Friday night and spent all of yesterday being tossed about, pitched around,
and rolled across the room. It was *bad*. There was one moment when the ship
rolled so far to the right that I was looking down on the water. William parked
himself on a couch for most of the day and wouldn&#x02bc;t move. The water is a
little calmer today, so we&#x02bc;re much more mobile today. But the worst part
about the storm is that we lost so much time in it that the captain decided to
cancel our stop in Naples altogether. So, no Pompeii or Capri for us this trip.
We&#x02bc;ll just have to come back again.

We&#x02bc;ve been taking lots of pictures and have some blogs to post when we
get home. Stay tuned!
