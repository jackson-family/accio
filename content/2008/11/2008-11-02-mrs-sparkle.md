We&#x02bc;re going on a cruise. I think we&#x02bc;ve established that fact. To
Italy, Greece, and Turkey, in case you didn&#x02bc;t know. We leave in 9 days.
It&#x02bc;s going to be amazing. Anyway.

One of the fun things about cruises is that they have Formal Nights. Ladies wear
sparkly things, men wear tuxes, and everyone looks beautiful. We&#x02bc;re
looking forward to this. The problem: I don&#x02bc;t have sparkly things.
We&#x02bc;re not fancy people.

Until now.

I am going to be sparkly, and it&#x02bc;s wonderful.
