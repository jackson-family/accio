I came across this passage in a book I just finished, _In the Company of
Cheerful Ladies_ by Alexander McCall Smith. It describes a woman debating
whether to spend her hard-earned bonus on a new pair of red shoes.

<blockquote class="blockquote pl-3 border-left">
    <p>What she needed now was to buy a smarter pair of shoes for use in the
    office, and she had in fact identified just such a pair in one of the
    stores. The shoes were red, and although they had no special coloured
    lining, they had two large gold ornamental buckles which gave them an air of
    authority that her other shoes did not have. These were bold shoes, and she
    would wear them when confronting difficult men, as she occasionally had to
    do. Men would be mesmerised by the buckles, and this would give her just the
    advantage that one needed when dealing with men like that.</p>

I love red shoes!
