Rebecca&#x02bc;s brother Mark and his family live in Round Rock, a short
15-minute drive from our home. We enjoy seeing him, his wife Monica, and his two
sons often. Today we had the privilege of babysitting the boys, John and Jacob,
while Mark and Monica went out on a date.

John was very recently introduced to *Star Wars*, and he loves the movies. He
has a light saber and everything. Of course, I as an uncle could not be any more
pleased at this. We watched *A New Hope* with the boys today.

If there is something John loves more than watching *Star Wars* at the moment,
it is acting along while he is watching *Star Wars*. To wit, here is an awesome
video:
