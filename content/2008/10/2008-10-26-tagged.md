So, I got tagged, which in Blog-speak, is a way of compelling people who read
your blog to fess up about themselves. Thanks, Kimberley!

#### 5 Things I was doing 10 years ago:

1. Finding out that I&#x02bc;d been accepted to BYU&#x02bc;s London Study Abroad
   program for Spring 1999. (Really, the rest of the year pales in comparison.)
2. Living with Kimberley, Sara, and Sue in Mountainwood Condos (wow, guys, has
   it really been that long??)
3. Changing my major from English to Classical Studies
4. Living in the Ancient Studies room at the Harold B. Lee Library, trying to
   get all my work done for two Latin classes and Classical Civilization 201.
  (It was a really, really hard year.)
5. Wondering why I didn&#x02bc;t really have any friends (see #4.)

#### 5 Things on my to-do list for today:

1. Read scriptures with William
2. Finish making Romano chicken for dinner (thanks, Natalie!)
3. Read my scriptures
4. Eat dessert with our friends Liz and Reed (they&#x02bc;ll be so excited about
   the cobbler we have baking right now)
