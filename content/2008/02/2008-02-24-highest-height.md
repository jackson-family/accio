Yesterday was a beautiful spring day &mdash; warm, breezy, and sunny. William
was testing out his new dragonfly robot. We had gotten it for Valentine&#x02bc;s
Day from my mom.

It&#x02bc;s supposed to be flown indoors, but our apartment is so tiny that when
William tried it out, it flew straight into the turtle tank. Anyway, it was a
perfect day to take it for a spin outside. You can see for yourself how it went.
I like how fast William is running. He was also yelling, &ldquo;Come back! Come
back!&rdquo;

I then made the off-hand comment that it would be a perfect day to fly a kite.
And the look on William&#x02bc;s face told me that I&#x02bc;d just come up with
the best idea he&#x02bc;d heard in weeks. We changed into appropriate
kite-flying attire and headed off to Dollar Tree in search of cheap kites.
Here&#x02bc;s what we found &mdash; I got the Superman kite, and William opted
for the Captain Jack Sparrow kite. Dollar Tree is the best store ever!

We found a small park near our apartment, which incidentally, the City of Austin
had purchased from the LDS Church in 1982. The wind was a decent kite-flying
speed, but it kept changing directions, which made it tricky to keep a kite
aloft. I finally resorted to just running around the park tugging on my kite
string, and that worked pretty well. But hey, I had the Superman kite, so of
course, he was going to fly!

William wasn&#x02bc;t as keen on running everywhere, so his kite struggled a
little.

Here&#x02bc;s a video. I felt like a little kid again with my kite, and
I&#x02bc;m sure that we&#x02bc;ll be going out there again.
