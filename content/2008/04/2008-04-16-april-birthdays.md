There are a few special people who have birthdays this month. First is my
amazing grandma, Mary Nelson. This is a picture of us in Utah last summer.
Isn&#x02bc;t she a cutie? We&#x02bc;re so lucky that she lives close to us so
that we could celebrate her birthday with her.

Next up is my nephew Jacob who turned 1. He&#x02bc;s come a long way and
doesn&#x02bc;t seem to have been at all affected by being born on a Friday the
13<sup>th</sup>. We love being able to watch him turn into a clever little boy.

Last but not least, my sweet mother-in-law Ellen turns 29 this month.
(That&#x02bc;s my story, and I&#x02bc;m sticking to it!) Doesn&#x02bc;t she look
great?
