The diagnosis is in &mdash; William has bronchitis. He went back to the doctor
yesterday morning and came home with a diagnosis and a prescription for a nifty
inhaler and cough syrup laced with codeine. We&#x02bc;ve already picked up both
drugs, and I think they&#x02bc;re helping a lot. The cough syrup appears to have
conked him out, though, so that will be a right-before-bedtime drug only. But he
appears to be on the mend, for which I am most grateful! Somehow, illnesses are
just a little less scary once they have a name.

Now we just need to get me well, since I&#x02bc;ve come down with a bad cold.
When it rains, it pours, right?
