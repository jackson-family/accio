We are getting better! William&#x02bc;s medicine seems to have worked wonders,
since his cough was mostly gone by Saturday afternoon. We were both well enough
to take in General Conference on Sunday in New Braunfels. But I stayed home from
work on Monday, since I still wasn&#x02bc;t feeling my best. And I went back to
work today, and all is well.

I missed two days of work, and William missed five. Only one of those days
overlapped where we stayed home together. And that was a fun day! We went to
Costco to pick up William&#x02bc;s prescription, so we got to have hot dogs for
lunch. And then we came home and played games all afternoon and ordered Chinese
food from Super China for dinner.

But yesterday was pretty boring because I didn&#x02bc;t have anyone to talk to
(everyone else was being responsible and working hard or studying), all of my
Scrabulous games were waiting for someone else&#x02bc;s turn, and I&#x02bc;d
typed into OneNote all of the recipes that I cared to type for one day. Despite
how boring it all was, I still couldn&#x02bc;t help but think that I would
rather be at home sick than at work. (That reminds me of that one *Office*
episode where they&#x02bc;re talking to the ex-con, and he&#x02bc;s telling them
about prison life, and Kevin says that he&#x02bc;d so rather be in prison than
working for Dunder-Mifflin.)

Anyway, thanks to all for their concern and encouragement, and thanks to Natalie
for the tip on OneNote!
