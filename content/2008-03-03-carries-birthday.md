(Last post from me today, I promise.) Today is my sister Carrie&#x02bc;s
25<sup>th</sup> birthday, and I wanted to wish her the happiest of birthdays
today. Here are some things that everyone should know about Carrie.

1.  She is sassy and really funny. (You should read [her blog][a], if you
    don&#x02bc;t believe me.)
2.  She is tougher than you might think she is.
3.  She&#x02bc;s pretty darn cute.
4.  She is an amazing cook.
5.  She is the best sister ever.

Happy Birthday, Carrie!
