I&#x02bc;ve been reading up a storm lately. I go through phases. My previous
phase involved breadbaking, and now I&#x02bc;m reading everything I can get my
hands on. (I don&#x02bc;t think the bread phase is over yet, though. Fear not!)

Two good books that I read and would recommend:

1. [_Same Kind of Different as Me_][a] by Ron Hall and Denver Moore. I&#x02bc;m
   amazed at the courage that some people have in the face of life&#x02bc;s many
   oppositions. This book is a lesson about the meaning of true friendship and
   the transforming power of pure love. It made me cry but the message is too
   good to pass up.
2. _84 Charing Cross Road_ by Helene Hanff. This is an older book, published in
   1970, but I just recently learned about it. Anyone who loves England and
   British people should read this book, along with its sequel, _Duchess of
   Bloomsbury_. I actually liked the sequel better, since it&#x02bc;s about the
   author&#x02bc;s first trip to London, and I identified so strongly with her
   feelings at being in that wonderful city after dreaming about it for so long.

And we saw _Valkyrie_ last weekend and thought it was a great movie, even though
all of the Germans had American or English accents.
