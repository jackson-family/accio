* Other teachers who restrained at least one of the kids: 3
* Number of times that I had to pick up a kid: 10

  thought about ear, but it never actually came to that)

  necklace: 5
* Number of times she hit him back: 3
* Number of toys that had to be hidden: 2

  don&#x02bc;t think that the thought didn&#x02bc;t cross my mind, too)
* Attempts to play with the microphone in the Primary room: 4
* Trips to the bathroom: 2

Yes, my class was so astonishingly and shockingly bad today that the Primary
presidency is having a meeting this week to talk about what to do with them.
