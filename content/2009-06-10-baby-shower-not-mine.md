I volunteered a few months ago to throw a baby shower for one of my friends in
the ward. I was her visiting teacher at the time, and I thought it would be fun
to throw a party. So, I found myself last Saturday morning in my fancy schmancy
new kitchen with its spacious island and well stocked fridge and gas range and
convection oven/microwave cooking up a storm. Somehow, in all of the excitement
of cooking a huge pile of food in my kitchen, I didn&#x02bc;t take any better
pictures of the food than this one. But trust me, it was all delicious.

Here are the recipes that I made:

* [Buttermilk Rolls][a] (I think from now on, I will make a point of keeping a
  bottle of buttermilk in my fridge. This stuff seriously works food miracles.)
* [Sonoma Chicken Salad][b] (Poppyseed dressing saves this salad. I&#x02bc;ve
  been eating the leftovers all week, and I usually don&#x02bc;t even like
  celery or nuts!)
* [Broccoli Slaw][c] (Way more interesting than cole slaw, except use a food
  processor to chop it all up. Otherwise, it&#x02bc;ll take forever!)
* [Homemade Salsa][d] (My friend who made the adorable cupcakes in the picture
  above has already eaten at least a half gallon of this stuff at my house. Good
  thing we got more tomatoes in our veggie box today.)
* [Coconut Lemon Loaf][e] (Yum, yum, yum, and more buttermilk!)

These were all new recipes to me, and I was pretty excited to try them out on a
crowd. I do that, you know. Trying new recipes on my friends is one of my
favorite tricks.

The shower was so fun. The food was great, we had a good bunch of people from
the ward join the festivities, the games weren&#x02bc;t embarrassing or
ridiculous, and the honoree went home with a great big pile of little boy gifts.
Mission accomplished.
