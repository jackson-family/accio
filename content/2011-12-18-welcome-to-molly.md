Molly Ellen Jackson was born on December 14 at 2:22 pm. William did a great job
of summing up the day she was born so I&#x02bc;ll just use his words.

<blockquote class="blockquote pl-3 border-left">
    <p>This morning I accompanied Rebecca to her regular weekly checkup. At the
    end of the checkup, her doctor had her sit for a
    <a href="http://americanpregnancy.org/prenatal-testing/non-stress-test/">Fetal
    Non-Stress Test</a>. The doctor was not happy with the results, so he sent
    us upstairs to the ultrasound folks for a closer look.</p>

    <p>The ultrasound technician spent 30 minutes looking for certain kinds of
    movement, which she did not see. The baby&#x02bc;s heart was beating just
    fine, but she was just a little too good at being as still as can be. Back
    at the doctor&#x02bc;s office with those results, we learned about our
    options and then went right over to the hospital to be induced.</p>

    <p>After we got settled in the delivery room, I ducked out for two hours to
    make sure Emily was taken care of. I got back to the hospital just as
    Rebecca&#x02bc;s doctor was coming in to check on her again. During those
    two hours there was still not enough activity, so the doctor ordered a
    C-section (at about 2:00 this afternoon). At 2:22 Molly came out with the
    umbilical cord wrapped around her neck three times and her legs twice more.
    Once she was free of the cord, she gave a beautiful cry. She and Rebecca are
    sleeping quite peacefully right now.</p>

    <p>We are grateful for the care Rebecca&#x02bc;s doctor showed and his
    ability to spot trouble early. We know the Lord is watching over us. There
    is probably no way Molly would have survived a vaginal delivery.</p>

So, there you have it. We&#x02bc;re so happy that she&#x02bc;s here, and in fine
form to boot. I try not to think too hard about what would&#x02bc;ve happened if
I hadn&#x02bc;t made an offhand comment to my doctor about how she seemed to be
moving around a little less, or how I was a little aggravated about being sent
to the hospital for an induction. This is a story whose happy ending I am most
thankful for, even if the delivery didn&#x02bc;t go the way I originally wanted!

So far, Molly is a dream baby and has done little but eat and sleep. Just like
her big sister, she cries only when something is wrong, and that&#x02bc;s
usually easy to fix. She&#x02bc;s pretty cuddly and loves being held, which
suits us just fine. She has a thick shock of very dark and unruly brown hair,
which only adds to her charm. I can&#x02bc;t really tell who she looks like just
yet, but I think that she might have William&#x02bc;s mouth and a smile dimple
on her left cheek.

As for me, my recovery from the C-section is going so well. I can&#x02bc;t
believe how much better I feel this time around &mdash; Emily&#x02bc;s delivery
was much more difficult to recover from. But I&#x02bc;ve had no complications
from this delivery, and I&#x02bc;m walking around and getting to the bathroom
without any assistance. Maybe I&#x02bc;m weird, but having a C-section really
agrees with me.

This is the embarrassing part. We forgot to take our camera to the hospital, so
the only pictures I have of Molly&#x02bc;s birthday are from William&#x02bc;s
cell phone. I&#x02bc;ll do my best to get some better pictures up shortly, and
then you can decide for yourself what to think of Molly.
