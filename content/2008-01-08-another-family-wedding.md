William and I went to Idaho on Friday to attend his brother Eric&#x02bc;s
wedding. We drove up from Salt Lake City in the morning and spent a collective 8
hours on I-15 that day. Idaho is a really odd place, I&#x02bc;ve decided.
Here&#x02bc;s one bit of evidence: there was an exit sign off of I-15 labeled
&ldquo;Exit 13&rdquo; and underneath, it read &ldquo;Exit 13&rdquo; with an
arrow. I guess they really want people to be able to find the town named Exit
13.

The wedding was in St. Anthony, Idaho, which is just north of Rexburg. The
wedding itself was very simple. It was in the St. Anthony stake center, and
their bishop performed the ceremony. He had some very kind words of
encouragement and counsel for the couple, and then they were married. The
ceremony was followed by family pictures and a wedding luncheon.

The Jacksons were well represented, but we still missed the Minnesota,
Greenville, and Taiwan bunch. I got to meet several aunts and uncles and
cousins, though if I were pressed to name them all, I wouldn&#x02bc;t be able to
do it. Next time, I&#x02bc;m packing nametags and a Sharpie to help me keep
everyone straight. We were glad to be there to support Eric and Callie in their
new adventure together, and it was a blast to hang out with the family.

After the wedding celebration ended, we piled back into our car and headed back
to Salt Lake. We stopped in Rexburg and Idaho Falls to check out their
respective temples. I figured that it might be a little while before we ever
made it back to Idaho, so I wanted to see the temples. It was definitely time
well spent, even if it took us an extra hour to get back to Salt Lake City.

The last bit of our adventure consisted of a snow storm arriving in Salt Lake at
the same time that we did. We stopped at Grandma Jackson&#x02bc;s house in
Holladay to say hello to her and goodbye to the Texas Jacksons who were driving
home the next day. When we arrived at her house, we found that the storm had
knocked out the power. Flashlights and candles were blazing inside, but it
definitely made for a less than favorable scene for our first meeting. But we
were glad that everyone arrived from Idaho safely and wished them well on their
long drive back to Texas.

I&#x02bc;ll post the rest of our trip in a separate entry.
