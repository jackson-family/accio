You start with a humble pumpkin, carefully selected. Pick one you like, but try
not to get too emotionally attached to it, because &hellip;

You cut a hole in the top and remove the insides. Use a big knife. If you
can&#x02bc;t bring yourself to commit this kind of carnage, it is okay to get a
friend to do it. You can carve a face if you want, but don&#x02bc;t make it too
cute, because &hellip;

You dismantle the pumpkin. The easiest way is to cut it in half vertically. This

You bake the pumpkin for an hour or two, then scrape the flesh out and puree it.
Then you bake pumpkin pies, pumpkin bread, pumpkin cookies, and pumpkin muffins.
Then you give them to your friends and family. Then everyone loves you.

Moral: Halloween can be fun even if no one knocks on your door asking for candy.
