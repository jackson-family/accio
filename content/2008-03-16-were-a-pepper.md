William and I spent this weekend in Waco with the Jacksons. The primary reason
for the trip was to celebrate William&#x02bc;s birthday with his family. But we
were long overdue for a visit to Waco anyway, since our last trip fell
completely through. And we had a great time! On Saturday, we made
William&#x02bc;s birthday dinner, pretended to be tourists, and played canasta
with Ellen and Larry.

Saturday morning, Ellen and I made William&#x02bc;s surprise meal, which was
cheesy chicken Kiev (with this yummy Cheddar cheese from Wisconsin) and a
chocolate almond brownie cake. Yum! Of course, it was a little intimidating
being in the kitchen with Ellen, master cook extraordinaire, but we had a good
time getting everything ready.

Then William and I set out to be tourists in Waco. Our first stop was the
[Dr Pepper Museum][a]. I had no idea that there was so much to say about a soft
drink, but there&#x02bc;s 3 floors worth. Who knew?? Probably, the most stunning
thing that I learned about Dr Pepper is that 1 oz of syrup, 6 pounds of sugar,
and 70 gallons of soda water will make 73 bottles of Dr Pepper. So, the lesson
there is that if anyone offers you a taste of the pure syrup, DON&#x02bc;T drink
it. Next stop was the oldest suspension bridge in Texas. Last stop was the
Central Texas Marketplace for a bit of shopping. William found some running
shoes, and I found a sweet red dress at Ann Taylor Loft.

That night, we ate dinner (chicken Kiev, twice baked potatoes, salad, and the
cake). Matthew disappeared to play video games. Ellen had taught me the basics
of canasta earlier in the afternoon, while we were waiting for dinner to bake,
so after dinner, we tried out my new-found canasta skills with Larry and Ellen.
A good time was had by all, but I&#x02bc;ll say that none of us has a very good
poker face when it comes to card games.
