You tell me. I would&#x02bc;ve voted a most lusty &ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; a few
months ago, but then I had Emily and suddenly everything that could be condensed
to the size of a small baby became cute. Like shoes. Emily usually wears socks
(or nothing at all &mdash; sorry, Grandmother!) but I found a pair of pink
tennis shoes in her stash on Friday and couldn&#x02bc;t resist putting them on.
And boy, were they cute.

And I think she thinks they&#x02bc;re cute, too.
