Emily loves going to nursery at church. In fact, she would skip sacrament
meeting altogether if it meant more nursery time. (Actually, so would I, but
that&#x02bc;s a different matter altogether.) Anyway, each week she comes home
with some scribbled picture that ostensibly had something to do with the lesson
in class. Usually, they are nothing more than scribbles, and I compliment her
work and toss it in the trash. But the coloring page from last week&#x02bc;s
nursery struck me as terribly funny and surprisingly aggressive for a 21-month
old.
