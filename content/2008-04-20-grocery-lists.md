When I was in college, I learned quickly that it was dangerous to go grocery
shopping without a list. This was especially true when I would shop at Food4Less
in Provo. So, I like making grocery lists, and William and I usually spend a
good 30 minutes during the week making up a grocery list for the next
week&#x02bc;s meals.

Yesterday, William went to the grocery store with a list that I had made, and I
realized that there were some ambiguities on the list. For example, I had
written &ldquo;jam,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;raspberry jam for the scones
I&#x02bc;m taking to Liz&#x02bc;s baby shower.&rdquo; But all William had to
work with was &ldquo;jam,&rdquo; so he reverted to a conversation that
we&#x02bc;d had over breakfast where he very politely declined to put
lingonberry jam on his toast, and I had said, &ldquo;We should get you some
jelly that you like.&rdquo; And so he came home with grape jam. (But it worked
out OK because the scones were tasty enough without jam.)

Then today, we stumbled upon [this oddly addictive website][a] that displays old
grocery lists that, I can only assume, were retrieved from the trash or
submitted by readers. I&#x02bc;d like to meet the person who made this list:

At least I&#x02bc;m not that obsessive about my lists. And this list looks like
it was written by a wife who sent her husband to the store, against her better
judgment:

Anyway, lists are fun.
