News flash! Today was graduation and I graduated today. My parents and brother
Matthew came to Austin to see it. It was at 8:00 in the morning, so I am really
grateful they pulled themselves out of bed to come support me.

Rebecca was there, too, of course. She is the best.

I&#x02bc;ve been working on this for a long time, and I am happy to be finally
done.
