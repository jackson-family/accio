I&#x02bc;m home alone tonight while William takes care of those wiggly kids that
are pretending to be Boy Scouts. (Can 11-year old boys really be Boy Scouts and
sharpen knives and start fires and other highly dangerous tasks?)

Rosh Hashanah was yesterday. It&#x02bc;s one of those holidays that I&#x02bc;ve
always seen on the calendar and said, &ldquo;Huh, that&#x02bc;s a funny name for
a holiday. I wonder how you pronounce that,&rdquo; but never gave a second
thought to. (Not that I spend a lot of time wondering how to pronounce the other
holidays on the calendar. Except maybe Yom Kippur &hellip;) I remember Dr.
Huntsman at BYU got up on Rosh Hashanah all excited to tell us about its deep
symbolism and significance in Jewish culture, but the only thing that I remember
about what he taught us is that he finally pronounced it out loud. Turns out
I&#x02bc;d been saying it wrong in my head for years. Anyway.

This year, a couple of the food blogs that I like had [Rosh Hashanah recipes][a]
that looked really good. So, I did a little more reading and found out that Rosh
Hashanah is the Jewish New Year. How cool is that to have a religious New Year
and a secular New Year? I really like the idea of having a religious New Year,
where you attend religious services and present yourself to God and lay out your
commitments to him for the next year. The other thing I learned is that many
Jews believe that Rosh Hashanah is the time when God decides who will live and
die in the next year. All this time, this wonderful holiday had been happening,
and I was unaware of its deep significance.

I&#x02bc;ve been so taken with this new knowledge of mine that William and I
made a Rosh Hashanah-worthy [butternut squash][b] soup last night. And it was
*good*. And I bravely made a challah bread, which is another word that, until
about 3 weeks ago, I didn&#x02bc;t know how to pronounce correctly.
[Here][c]&#x02bc;s the recipe I used. It turned out just like the picture! That
never happens to me, so I am convinced that perhaps God was smiling on my small
attempt to acknowledge our Jewish cousins and their fine traditions. Happy New
Year!
