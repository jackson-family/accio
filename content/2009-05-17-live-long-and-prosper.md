We saw the new Star Trek movie on Friday night. First of all, it was amazing and
I want to see it again! The actors all dove head first into their characters,
and the plot clipped along at a manageable pace with a nice, tightly wrapped
ending.

Second of all, does anyone else see a slight resemblance here?
