December was not a great month for blogging. But that&#x02bc;s OK, because I was
busy getting sick (gah) and getting ready for Christmas. Woo hoo. Here are some
of the highlights:

We went to Idaho for Sarah&#x02bc;s wedding the second weekend in December. It
was about negative 20 degrees (or at least, it felt like it) and snowy, but
somehow we kept warm enough to wish Sarah and Matt all the best.

While we were waiting for Sarah and Matt to leave the temple, Andrew and Margie
Walker came down from Rexburg to see us! They came down, even though the roads
hadn&#x02bc;t been cleared off yet. True friends!

On our drive up to Idaho, we stopped in Logan to have lunch with the Steeds, a
CES missionary couple that served in Austin while William and I were dating.
They were kind of like surrogate grandparents and we were happy to see them and
get caught up on their adventures.

We ate dinner with Carrie at Burgers Supreme in Provo. Best burgers in the
world, hands down. And their fry sauce &mdash; *mmmm*. I wish we could find a
place in Austin that matched up. Carrie must have been really excited about
wearing William&#x02bc;s hat.

That trip to Idaho and Utah pretty much did me in, and I&#x02bc;m resolved not
to do any major traveling for a good while. That&#x02bc;s a pretty big statement
for me, huh?

Back in Austin, on the Monday before Christmas, we had a Christmas FHE with
friends from our ward. We ate delicious food, sang Christmas songs, made
ornaments, and played with our friends&#x02bc; baby boy. We didn&#x02bc;t go so
far as to put him in a manger and make him play Baby Jesus, though, because he
seemed to like being held rather than gazed upon lovingly by sheep and wise men.

We spent Christmas Day in New Braunfels with the Allens. William and I went to
the Methodist Church Christmas Eve service with my grandmother and had a great
time. Any church that passes out candles is OK in my book!

The following weekend, we drove up to Waco on Saturday and Sunday for an open
house for Sarah and Matt and Sunday dinner with the family. We chased kids
around all weekend and played lots of games and ate delicious food.

It was a good month!
