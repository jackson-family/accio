I like making pies, and I&#x02bc;m always trying new ones. Custard pies, cream
pies, meringue pies &mdash; they&#x02bc;re all good. The one pie that
I&#x02bc;ve been afraid to try is an apple pie. Why, you say? Isn&#x02bc;t there
something about baseball, moms and apple pie being all that make America good
and true?

First, because I&#x02bc;m terrible at lattice tops. I tried to make one for a
peach cobbler once and ended up mad. Gah. (But why does an apple pie have to
have a lattice top? Why, why, why? Does it make the pie taste better? Probably
not. And it aggravates the cook, especially if the cook is me.) Second, because
I think peeling and thinly slicing 4 lbs of apples is annoying. I&#x02bc;ve made
apple butter a few times, and it&#x02bc;s the same idea. Peel, peel, peel, peel
for 30 minutes and then slice, slice, slice, slice for another 30 minutes. As
you can see, I don&#x02bc;t really have the temperament for a lovingly and
beautifully crafted apple pie that took me hours to make and that will be eaten
in a matter of minutes. At least with apple butter, you end up with a lot, and
it lasts a long time. A much better return on investment of time, in my opinion.

Well, now I&#x02bc;m going to have to make an apple pie. What?

This is why. A few weeks ago, William and I found ourselves in Marshall&#x02bc;s
exploring the shelves in the back of the store where they have all of the fun,
random housewares. And we found an apple slicer/corer/peeler. I&#x02bc;d read
about those on the Bakers Banter blog, but I just couldn&#x02bc;t imagine that
something as wonderful as that could really work for an amateur like me. But it
was only $15, so we thought we&#x02bc;d try it out and see if it really did
slice/core/peel.

And it *did*! Looky, looky. First you pop the apple on the machine. And then you
turn the handle.

And it peels and cores and slices that apple in about 10 seconds. Amazing! And
if you like apple peel, this is what you end up with.

How do you like them apples?
