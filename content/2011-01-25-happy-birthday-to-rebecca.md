We celebrated Rebecca&#x02bc;s birthday last week. On Monday, many of her family
members came to our home for lunch. She made an incredibly delicious baked
potato soup. Her sister Carrie brought rolls and her mother brought cake.

On Wednesday, her actual birthday, I got off work early and came home to watch
Emily so she could do whatever she wanted. She got her bangs trimmed and ran
some other errands, too. In the evening we took Emily to a friend&#x02bc;s house
and we went to dinner at California Pizza Kitchen. We enjoyed the pizza, but we
absolutely adored our appetizer: [Avocado Club Egg Rolls][a]. We plan to make
these ourselves soon.

I made a [Coconut Dream Tart][b] at Rebecca&#x02bc;s request, and we both loved
that, too.
