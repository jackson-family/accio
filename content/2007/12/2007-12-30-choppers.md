Here&#x02bc;s what I wanted to blog about the most. For Christmas, Mom gave
remote control helicopters to Dad, Mark, and William. (This goes well with
William&#x02bc;s tenet of &ldquo;I really just want a present that I can rip
open and play with right there.&rdquo;) William ripped it open and tried to play
with it right there, but as luck would have it, the battery required 4 hours of
initial charging. As soon as the batteries were fully charged, the boys were out
in the front yard trying out their new toys. The problem with the front yard is
that there are cedar trees that evidently like to eat remote control
helicopters. Here are some pictures. I am quite proud of the ingenuity that
William, Dad, and Mark displayed in trying to get their helicopters to work.
