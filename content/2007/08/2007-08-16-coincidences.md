1.  This morning as I was walking from the bus stop to work with Luis, he saw
something on the ground and said, &ldquo;Is that a passport?&rdquo; I picked it
up, and yes it was. I took it to work and looked up the owner in the directory,
then I called him. He happened to be in the same building I was in, and he came
to pick it up. &ldquo;That is nothing short of an act of God,&rdquo; he said as
he walked away.

2.  I ordered at Wendy&#x02bc;s for lunch and paid and put my change in my
pocket. Everything was normal. The girl that ordered after me got something that
came to $2.05, so she pulled two dollar bills out of her little purse and
started looking for coins in the bottom. It became apparent to me that she
wasn&#x02bc;t going to find any coins, so I pulled a handful out of my pocket,
located a nickel, and slid it onto the counter. Smiles all around. Then I turned
around and looked on the ground and saw a dime. So I picked it up and put it in
my pocket.
