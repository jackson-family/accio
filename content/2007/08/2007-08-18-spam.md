This morning I got a piece of junk email from &ldquo;macit Roan&rdquo;
(macitRoan@qc7services.com) with the subject: &ldquo;It wasn&#x02bc;t Dobby - it
was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry&#x02bc;s friend Dobby had
been.&rdquo; Needless to say I was really excited and opened the message
immediately.

I was dismayed to find nothing more about this strange house-elf that
wasn&#x02bc;t Dobby, but just a friendly notice that &ldquo;T,H_E MAR\*KET IS
ABOU\*T TO P'O_P., A+N_D SO IS E,X-M,T'!&rdquo; Also at the very end of the
message, it got a bit classy with some French: &ldquo;Rend'ez de ma p.a-r_t
m'e_s p'l'u-s pro-fo'nds respec_ ts a M_- m,e votr+e m,e_r-e et M_-.r v otre
pere'2.&rdquo; which basically means, &ldquo;Give my most profound regards to
your mother and father.&rdquo;

But what&#x02bc;s going to happen to Harry?!
