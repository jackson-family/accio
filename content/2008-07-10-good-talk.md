Last night, William had Scouts, so I found myself at home alone for a little
while. I&#x02bc;d made a mental list of things that I wanted to get done, like
mop the kitchen, throw in a load of laundry, vacuum the apartment, email some
old friends, and scrub the bathtub. Now that I think about it, I&#x02bc;m not
sure how all of that was going to happen in one evening!

But as I was putting dishes away, I had a sudden flash-thought that I should
call my mother. Dad has church meetings during the week, so she often finds
herself at home alone in the evenings. And so, I set aside all of my other ideas
and called my mother. And Dad answered the phone. So, I guess she didn&#x02bc;t
really *need* my company last night. But Dad was nice enough to hand the phone
to her anyway, and we had a nice long chat. We didn&#x02bc;t talk about anything
especially important, except maybe baking bread which is a very important topic,
but it was such a nice chat that I was smiling the rest of the evening.

And when William came home from Scouts slightly worn out from playing wallball,
we visited on the couch until bedtime and talked about nothing in particular,
except baking bread did come up again. Hmm. The point of this post is that
sometimes it&#x02bc;s nice to set aside the silly little things that we do with
our free time and have a good talk with someone that we love.
