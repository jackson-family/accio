Emily just passed the three-week mark on Monday. Time flies! I&#x02bc;m settling
into my new role of stay-at-home mom, but it has been an adjustment, to be sure.
It&#x02bc;s a good thing that Emily is a pretty easy baby, most of the time. One
of the shower gifts that I got was a baby book, but I haven&#x02bc;t done a
single thing to update it. But there are things that I want to remember about
her at this tiny, fresh baby stage, so I&#x02bc;ll just put them here.

1. Her eyes are so blue and shiny. She has pale eyelashes and eyebrows that are
   really hard to see, except in good light.
2. When she&#x02bc;s hungry, she holds out her right arm in a way that makes it
   look like she&#x02bc;s beseeching someone, anyone, to feed her, kind of like
   a gesture Charlton Heston would make. I think it&#x02bc;s really funny.
3. When we bathe her and dry her hair just right, it sticks straight up and
   stays up until the next time we wash it. I really need to get a picture of
   it.
4. When she&#x02bc;s falling asleep, she makes the funniest faces ranging from
   frowns to smiles to perfectly round little lips. And sometimes her eyes open
   and shut randomly.
5. She seems to prefer being naked. Uh oh.
6. Her cries sound just like she&#x02bc;s saying, &ldquo;Waaa. Waaa.
   Waaa.&rdquo; I know, that&#x02bc;s a dumb thing to say, but it really does
   sound just like that.
7. When she&#x02bc;s thinking hard, her forehead crinkles up like an old
   man&#x02bc;s forehead.
8. We&#x02bc;ve been forced to supplement her feedings with formula, and when
   she finishes a bottle, she looks like she&#x02bc;s in a coma. &ldquo;*Man*,
   that was good!&rdquo; is what she seems to be thinking as she settles in for
   a long nap.

And to commemorate three weeks, I put her in her first 0-3 month outfit today.
What do you think?
