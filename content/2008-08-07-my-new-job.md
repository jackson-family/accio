I&#x02bc;m four days into my new job, so I thought I&#x02bc;d write a bit to
satisfy those of you who are curious about how things are going.

The good things: the ladies on my team are really nice and have tried hard to
welcome me. This department likes to party, too. They had a birthday bowl of
fruit for my vegetarian boss on Monday, and today we went to lunch at a Thai
restaurant to celebrate the vegetarian boss&#x02bc; birthday again. And
they&#x02bc;ve already figured out that my next birthday will be the big 3-0 and
how to celebrate it, even though it&#x02bc;s not until January.

The bad thing: it&#x02bc;s pretty darn boring. Right now, they have me reading
old grant proposals to learn about their process for reviewing proposals and the
evaluation criteria that they use. So, I&#x02bc;ve spent the last four days
sitting in my cube, reading and reading and reading. No meetings, no email(!!!),
no noisy co-workers, no juggling 15 projects at once. So, we&#x02bc;ll see how
it shakes out once they actually trust me enough to give me some real work to
do.

But at least I&#x02bc;m getting paid more, right?
