I&#x02bc;m a bit behind, but I still wanted to write about some of the fun
things that we did for Christmas in New Braunfels. Here are some highlights.

Christmas Eve, William and I drove down to San Antonio to meet the rest of my
family to do family pictures at JC Penney. There have been several additions to
our family since the last picture, so we figured that it was time for an update.
The pictures all went well enough, with a minimum of hair pulling and tears. (If
I can figure out a way to post them here, I will.) William and I would like to
do an annual family picture, except maybe not on Christmas Eve with all of the
other families that seize upon that brief time of family togetherness to do
their own pictures.

We had our annual Christmas Eve dinner of tamales and chili. I don&#x02bc;t know
why we started doing it, since we don&#x02bc;t have any Mexican ancestry, but
I&#x02bc;m OK with the tradition because the tamales were yummy.

Several years ago, I decided that I wanted to go to the Christmas Eve service at
the First United Methodist Church in New Braunfels with my grandmother. I mostly
didn&#x02bc;t like the idea of her having to attend a Christmas Eve service
alone and in the dark, so I went and had an amazing time. So, if I am in New
Braunfels on Christmas Eve, I go with Grandmother to the Methodist Church, sing
all the cool Christmas carols that Mormons don&#x02bc;t sing in church (O Holy
Night, We Three Kings, and the other verses of some familiar carols), light a
candle while singing &ldquo;Silent Night&rdquo; with hundreds of other people,
and just enjoy sharing Christmas Eve with Christians everywhere. This year,
William went with me, and it was even more amazing.

Christmas Day was fun. John and Jacob, my two nephews, were so well behaved! I
thought that we&#x02bc;d be up by 6 a.m. opening presents, but the boys managed
to hold it together until about 9:30. I think it helped that Mark and Monica
plied them with stockings first to tide them over. We all got an abundance of
gifts, the most amazing of which (for me) were a digital camera from William and
a pink shirt from Eddie Bauer that does not wrinkle. Yay &mdash; amazing
pictures AND no ironing!

Here are two pictures that I think are really, really funny. John got a bike for
Christmas, but he wasn&#x02bc;t the only one who had fun with it.
