Emily&#x02bc;s laugh is starting to come out in full force. Yesterday, she
started cracking up and laughed at who-knows-what for at least 5 minutes. I was
cracking up, too, because it was just so cute!

Here&#x02bc;s a video that gives you a small taste of what it&#x02bc;s like. It
would seem that Emily has a rather dark sense of humor, though. See what part of
the song cracks her up?
