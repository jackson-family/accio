Remember a few weeks ago when [Rebecca talked about the CROP Walk][a]? Well, the
time has arrived. The Walk itself (and the deadline for donations) is this
Saturday, March 1.

CROP stands for &ldquo;Communities Responding to Overcome Poverty&rdquo;. The
money we raise helps combat poverty both locally and worldwide.

We are working as a team with our ward, and we invite you to donate to the CROP
Walk cause; just visit the Shoal Creek Ward donation page (link removed) and
click &ldquo;General Team Donation&rdquo; to donate to the general team, or
click my name (William Jackson) to donate to our personal page. Regardless of
which page you use to donate, the money goes to the same place, neither of which
is me.

We will be sure to take plenty of pictures at the Walk and show you how much fun
we had. This one is from last year:
