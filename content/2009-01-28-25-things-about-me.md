I got tagged on Facebook by my friend Melissa. I didn&#x02bc;t know you could do
that. But hello, just because I am your Facebook friend does not mean that I
want you to know 25 things about me. So, I&#x02bc;ll respond to the tag here
where I have some degree of control over who reads this, instead of in Facebook
where things have a way of turning up months later.

So, 25 things about me, huh? That&#x02bc;s better than Chelsea&#x02bc;s tag
where she had to come up with like 100 things.

1.  My grandfather bred tall bearded irises, and he named one of the breeds
    after me, Rebecca Anne.
2.  I realized that I was falling for William at a dance of all places, which is
    so ironic because I used to roll my eyes when my youth leaders would tell us
    that we had a good chance of meeting our future spouse at a dance. And we
    weren&#x02bc;t even each other&#x02bc;s date. Whoops.
3.  It really bothers me when people give their kids names that are deliberately
    misspelled for the sake of cuteness, individuality, whatever. Not that I can
    do anything about it, but I just think, &ldquo;Poor kid. Isn&#x02bc;t life
    hard enough without having to spell your name to everyone you meet?&rdquo;
4.  I think it&#x02bc;s amazingly funny when William clucks like a chicken. He
    had to do it one time when we played Curses with friends, and I still crack
    up thinking about it.
5.  I was the valedictorian of my high school class and spoke at my graduation.
    One of the things that I said was a key to success in life was to eat your
    vegetables. I haven&#x02bc;t been proven wrong yet.
6.  My favorite boy&#x02bc;s name is Michael, but no way am I naming my kid
    Michael Jackson. Too creepy.
7.  I was an intern in Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Department of Health and
    Human Services. My friend Janae worked with me, and we never had anything to
    do, so we&#x02bc;d spend all day emailing each other, even though our cubes
    were like 10 feet apart. And we still email all the time, even though we
    haven&#x02bc;t seen each other in 5 years.
8.  I really like being a Texan.
9.  I miss the seasons in Utah, even the snow at times. I&#x02bc;d love to be
    able to go snowshoeing again.
10. I don&#x02bc;t think that my job challenges me very much.
11. I like it when people comment on my blog.
12. If I had a million dollars, I would probably (a) buy William a shiny black
    fast European car; (b) buy a house and pay cash for it; and (c) put a pool
    in the house. Maybe it&#x02bc;s a good thing I don&#x02bc;t have a million
    dollars. Clearly I wouldn&#x02bc;t be very responsible with it. What I
    should&#x02bc;ve said: I would (a) buy William a used Toyota Camry; (b) put
    a 20% down payment on a house; and (c) save the rest for my retirement and
    kids&#x02bc; college.
13. I like finding old friends on Facebook. I&#x02bc;ve located most of my old
    BYU roommates, except for the crazy ones that I never want to talk to again
    and Sue Pickens. Does anyone know where she is these days?
14. I can find a Simpsons episode that relates to almost any situation that I
    find myself in. Here&#x02bc;s an example: in my previous post, I talked
    about William and I playing _Barbie: Queen of the Prom_. There&#x02bc;s a
    Simpsons episode where they all go to a beach house and they&#x02bc;re
    playing this board game. And Milhouse draws a boyfriend card, and Homer
    says, &ldquo;Ha ha! He looks like *you*, Poindexter.&rdquo; That&#x02bc;s a
    subtle but brilliant allusion to _Barbie: Queen of the Prom_! Another
    example of how well researched and written the Simpsons is.
15. I hate melons. I&#x02bc;ve tried them again and again, and they always make
    me gag. Especially cantaloupe. And I still feel bad about the time I told my
    sister to eat her melons, and they were bad, and I didn&#x02bc;t know it,
    but she ate them anyway, and she was sick. Poor baby.
16. If I could find a way to go teach English in Europe somewhere, I would
    totally do it. The only problem is that they already speak English over
    there, so not much chance of that happening.
17. I thought that John McCain was completely nuts for picking Sarah Palin as
    his VP. Seriously, did he think that undecided women voters are *that* dumb
    that they would vote for him just because he put a woman on the ticket? He
    should&#x02bc;ve picked Oprah, if he wanted a chance with the ladies.
18. The first time I drove my mom anywhere, I almost ran into the sign at the
    front of our subdivision going around a corner. She still holds onto the
    door when she rides with me, 15 years later.
19. The New York Times is my newspaper of choice. It often makes me mad, but the
    writing is better than anything else I can get, so I read it.
20. I am running out of things to say. I&#x02bc;m pretty boring.
21. I wear a size 9.5 shoe. I never had a roommate with feet my size, so I never
    could share shoes with them even though their shoes were usually cuter than
    mine.
22. We always sit at the front in church so I can hear better and so that I
    don&#x02bc;t spend the whole time looking at what other people are wearing.
23. I&#x02bc;ve never gotten a speeding ticket or a parking ticket.
24. One time at BYU, I saw this guy in my ward walking up a hill really slowly
    and blocking the sidewalk. So, I went up behind him and said, &ldquo;Sheesh,
    why are you walking so slow?&rdquo; in a kind of joking way. And the guy
    turned around and it totally wasn&#x02bc;t the guy in my ward, so I just had
    to play it cool, kind of like, &ldquo;Yeah, that&#x02bc;s right, I&#x02bc;m
    talking to you. Outta my way, slowpoke.&rdquo; So embarrassing!
25. I&#x02bc;ve been to London four times and still haven&#x02bc;t had my fill.
    I&#x02bc;ve been to Paris twice and am satisfied that I&#x02bc;ve seen it
    all. On my (our?) next trip to Europe, I&#x02bc;d like to see Scandinavia. I
    have a high school friend in Norway. Perfect excuse to go, right?

And I&#x02bc;m not going to tag anyone because most of you do a pretty good job
of updating your blogs anyway. Ooh, except maybe I tag William because he
doesn&#x02bc;t blog enough these days, and he always has interesting things to
say.
