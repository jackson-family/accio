Those of you who know my history with William Jackson will know that he&#x02bc;s
introduced me to all kinds of interesting websites that I, safely tucked away in
my very un-web-savvy world, would never have otherwise discovered. One of those
websites is Facebook, and I owe everything I know about and do on Facebook to
him, except maybe the way that all of my high school friends managed to find me
on there. (I owe that to their surprising ingenuity and determination, not mine
or William&#x02bc;s.) Anyway, Facebook recently opened up to software developers
who have developed all kinds of applications that will allow you to clutter up
your Facebook page, a la My Space, and waste way more time, a la MSN Games. Last
night, I decided to add my first application, a Facebook version of Scrabble,
called &ldquo;Scrabulous.&rdquo; With a catchy name like that, this game was
bound to catch on like wildfire, right? Well, I tentatively entered my first
game with William, of all people, and was doing fairly well until I hit a rough
spot and got several consecutive sets of nothing but vowels. So, I lost my first
Scrabulous game because I speak English, not Hawaiian.

The beauty of this game is that you can take as long as you like to play it and
check the status of the game or make a move every time you log into Facebook.
This means that you can have a game with a friend or two that will last hours,
even days or weeks, if your friends take their sweet time to make their next
move. And there&#x02bc;s no limit to the number of games you can have open. So,
now I have 6 games going on, which must mean that I&#x02bc;m addicted to the
game.

Also, please note one other interesting website that William has introduced me
to: this one. Yes, friends, this is my first ever blog post. And in the fine
fashion of other blogs dedicated to all things mundane and boring, I&#x02bc;ve
posted an entry that only a handful of people will truly appreciate. Thanks for
making this a memorable day.
