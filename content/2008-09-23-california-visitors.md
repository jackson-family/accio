Last weekend, my dad&#x02bc;s brother Jim, his wife Martine, his son John,
John&#x02bc;s wife Bianca, and their picture-perfect, oh, so cute, daughter
Marea came to visit New Braunfels from San Diego. These are the California
Allens (except for cousin James who had to hold down the fort in San Diego), the
cool cousins that we only got to see every few years. We loved going to visit
them in California because it usually meant that we would get Slurpees from 7-11
and take a trip to Disneyland. These are things that children raised in New
Braunfels, Texas didn&#x02bc;t get to do much.

They came to visit Texas for the first time in at least seven years, so it was
kind of a big deal. And we were so happy to see them again! My parents sailed
off to Alaska this weekend, so they missed the fun. (But I think they were
having plenty of fun on their cruise and probably ate even better than we did.)
Grandmother lives in a small apartment, and the cousins were staying in a hotel,
so we decided to use my parents&#x02bc; house for the big meals. It worked out
really well because we had plenty of room to set out the food and spread out.
And the kids *loved* being in the big back yard.

We didn&#x02bc;t really do much else besides eat, talk, and laugh, but it was so
much fun. I should probably let the pictures do most of the talking.

The kids loved being in the huge back yard. I don&#x02bc;t know if Marea had
ever seen that much land in her life.

And here&#x02bc;s Monica chasing Jacob, who&#x02bc;s tearing after something
very interesting.

This picture makes me laugh because the boys totally know that they are not
supposed to climb up there, and yet they make a beeline for that corner seat
every time!

I don&#x02bc;t know what&#x02bc;s up with my face here, but little John took
this picture.

And here I am with my brother Mark and my cousin John.

We played Kings on the Corners with Grandma. And she won. Big surprise &mdash;
look at her game face. She has it *on*.

Such a cute little family, John, Bianca, and Marea.

We finally managed to get our hands on Marea. Look at that red hair!

And here we got almost everyone into the picture, except for Martine who was
taking the pictures.

Thanks to all for such a fun and happy weekend!
